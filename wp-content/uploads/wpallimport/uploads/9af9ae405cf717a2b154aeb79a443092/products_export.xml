		<description><![CDATA[When it was introduced, the TRAM® TR50 miniature microphone revolutionized the industry- it has become the standard in feature film, television production and other areas of the entertainment industry. In addition to its diminutive size and superior sound quality, the TR-50 offers a combination of features that are simply not offered by any other microphone.

The TRAM® TR50 miniature professional lavalier microphone answers the needs of even the most demanding sound recording engineer. It has been designed with the latest electret development and electronics technology, to provide high sound quality with little or no visibility. Its small size and unique design permit a variety of uses and fastening options, that make it ideal for unobtrusive appearance and hidden mic use. The tiny omni-directional capsule features minimum sound coloration and is therefore easily combined with boom mics during post production. A variety of accessories makes mounting the mic on or under clothing easy, with reliable results.

The extended frequency response range and omni-directional characteristics have been designed to satisfy the most stringent requirements in all professional audio fields, particularly film and TV production.

		<description><![CDATA[The Microforce Zoom Control by Preston Cinema Systems has long been the de facto zoom control in the motion picture industry. It features a pressure sensitive thumb switch that controls both speed and direction. The harder you press, the faster you go. The range of speeds is controlled by a dial at the bottom of the unit. 

You can dial down the speed to attain slow creeps as long as 10 minutes from one end of the lens to the other. After performing a really slow zoom, pushing the Zap button allows you to zoom back to the start position at high speed. The control features a built-in switch to reverse thumb switch direction, and an external camera start-stop switch. 

Our Microforce comes with the Oppenheimer Pan Handle System. This system is a beautifully machined aluminum bracket designed to make the zoom control fit better into your hand and attach to the tripod of your choice. The pan handle fits all of our Sachtler 14, 18, and 20 tripods, and also fits the Sachtler 30 with an adapter.

		<features><![CDATA[- Provides consistent and accurate zooms that can be repeated.

- Zap button quickly zooms the lens back to the start position.

- Oppenheimer pan handle makes it easy to attach to Sachtler tripods.

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great traveling companion as well when it comes to video production shoots. This lighting combination is a great kit to use as back light, high light props, extra talent or fill in dark or shaded areas in a scene. But when it comes to outdoor shooting when the sun or daylight isn't in direct competition with the lights you will find this combo kit to be useful in shaded areas only. <BR><BR>Depending on the situation used in combination with 2 key lights this lighting kit can be used for talking heads, music videos, documentaries, industrials, multi media, web base streaming, film shoots you name it this kit gets around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dedolight 24 V Kit Hard Case 

The Dedolight system offers its unique advantages to professionals in many disciplines. The revolutionary optical system of the Dedolight far surpasses the traditional concept of studio lights with fresnel lenses. The Dedolight optical system employs two lenses - neither of which is a fresnel.

This lighting kit is great for interviews, projecting patterns on walls in the back round or patterns over back rounds that may stand out too much.

This is that lighting kit you wish you had on the last shot of the day in that tight spaced room. You know the room; the one with the single AC outlet in it.

Includes: three (3) DLH2 Universal 150W heads, DT24-3 150W power supply, DBD barndoors, head extension cables, stands, DP1 universal projection attachment, Gobo holder, misc Gobo patterns, travel case]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 4BANK SELECT System consists of a four lamp fixture operated by a remote ballast. The Select Ballast is flicker free at any camera speed or shutter angle with controls to power four or two lamps at high-output or standard-output settings. The same ballast will power 4ft or 2ft fixtures.

The 4BANK SELECT System is a soft key or fill source that can be used instead of diffusing light through fabric or bouncing light off foam core, as with conventional HMI or tungsten sources. As a comparison, the 4ft 4BANK is equal to a 1.2K HMI fresnel bounced, with these added advantages:

- Lower power consumption 

- Cooler operation 

- Better control of light with barn doors and louvers 

- Uses less set space 

- Can match to daylight, tungsten or existing fluorescent lighting without filtration 

The lightweight fixtures, weighing from 6 lbs to 10 lbs, make a day of multiple set ups quick and easy. At the end of the day, lamps can remain in the fixture for storage and transportation.

		<description><![CDATA[The Diva Lite 400 is a portable softlight, consistent with Kino Flo’s design commitment to compact, lightweight, component softlight systems.   This instrument incorporates a built-in dimmer and the ballast is built into the light itself.  Kino Flo recommends striking the instrument with the dimmer set to maximum and until the lamps come up to temperature.<P>
An incorporated output switch allows you to uitilize 2 or all 4 lamps. Turning off 2 lamps equals a one-stop reduction in light output without color shift.
<P>
This version of the Diva 400 is also designed with a proprietary power supply (85VAC to 265VAC) so there are no worries if you need to travel over seas with it.
<P>
Our light comes in a kit with 5 warm and 5 cool lamps (The Diva 400 requires 4), a gel frame, flozier (diffusion screen) and a silver louvered egg crate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The XDCAM EX PMW-350 is the first Sony memory shoulder-mount camcorder, equipped with the cutting edge imaging technology of three 2/3 inch-type Exmor√¢‚Äû¬¢ full HD CMOS sensors. These sensors, each with an effective pixel count of 1920 (H) x 1080 (V), give the camcorder an excellent sensitivity of F12 and a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio of 59 dB.

Additionally, the large 2/3 inch√¢‚Ç¨‚Äútype sensors can capture images with a shallower depth of field, giving users more freedom of creative expression. The PMW-350 is studio-configurable, with timecode in/out, genlock in, HD/SD SDI and HDMI out, and also features a DVCAM recording option.

Designed to be compact and ergonomically well-balanced, the PMW-350, with a main body weight of just over seven pounds, provides a high level of mobility and comfort in a wide variety of shooting situations. In addition, it has a low center of gravity, ensuring outstanding stability on the shoulder; and the PMW-350 is designed to be environmentally friendly thanks to its low power consumption of just 18 watts (while recording with supplied VF, lens, shotgun mic and one (1) SxS card). The PMW-350K model offers sales customers a Lens Package, equipped with an HD lens with 16x zoom and a standard 2/3-inch bayonet lens mount.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not all HMIs are created equal. This HMI from Bron Kobold earns its place on the set with weatherproof construction. 
<P>
When designing the lamp base and ballast, special emphasis was put on an efficient protection against dust and drip water. All openings are protected or sealed. The operating elements are equipped with a waterproof protective cap. The trigger unit is waterproof up to the bulb socket, allowing cold and hot triggering even in a humid environment. 
<P>
The lamp base housing is made from sturdy aluminum and steel. Despite the rugged design, and the various measures to make the equipment all-weather-proof, the weight and volume are comparatively small.

		<features><![CDATA[All-in-one design The Anycast Station comes equipped with a video switcher, audio mixer, an LCD display, and camera control functions, all packed into a compact attach√Ø¬ø¬Ω case design. This approach eliminates any external wiring and cumbersome signal adjustments, making setup extremely easy and quick. On the large LCD screen, there are two windows for monitoring the program and preview outputs, together with seven windows to view each individual input source plus one internal still picture source, eliminating the need for many picture monitors. These factors make the Anycast Station a powerful device for producing live events, virtually anywhere and with a minimum production crew. 

Easy and integrated operation The Anycast Station makes live event programming as simple as possible. This is because the Anycast Station requires very little or no technical knowledge of switcher and mixer setup and operations due to its extremely straightforward and intuitive control surface. the Anycast Station combines creative power and ease of operation in one integrated production system. 

Seamless switching between video and PC sources The Anycast Station allows live switching between a variety of signal sources - from standard definition video (Analog composite, S-Video, DV, and optional SDI), to High Definition sources (1080i & 720p), to PC images with various resolutions. Two important features make this possible - the sophisticated built-in line converters and the high-resolution internal processing. Additionally, the program can be output from a variety of interfaces including the standard analog composite, S-Video, DV, and optionally SDI using the BKAW-580 for video, or High Definition analog component outputs of either 1080i or 720p using the optional BKAW-560 interface module, and D-Sub 15-pin outputs for projectors and large screen displays. 

Multi-format combinations SD (NTSC or PAL), HD (1080i or 720p), PC RGB (XGA and SXGA) signals, can all be mixed together and output as SD (NTSC or PAL), HD (1080i or 720p), and Video or PC RGB (XGA or SXGA) signal. 

Flexible video input configurations The Anycast Station offers the following video and PC inputs. These are provided as interface modules installed in the slots of its rear panel:Primary inputs 1 to 4: Analog composite, S-Video, DV Primary inputs 5 to 6: RGB (VGA, XGA, SXGA)Should a different input configuration be required, the interface modules are also provided as optional accessories, allowing users to configure the system exactly as required. What's more, the Anycast Station allows each input on these modules to be assigned to any one of the primary inputs via simple menu settings. 

Multi-camera ISO recording for use as a nonlinear editing source During a live event, each signal source supplied to the Anycast Station's primary inputs can be recorded to external hard disk drive. The Anycast Station allows synchronized recording of two primary input sources (per video interface board) to a third-party IEEE1394-interface-equipped hard disk drive connected to its rear panel. This means that with only two hard disk drives, 4 primary inputs can be recorded. After the event, connecting these hard disk drives to an IEEE1394-equipped compatible nonlinear editor allows editing to start very quickly, with the benefits of using hard drive storage to feed the source material. 

Streaming Encoder and Streaming Server The Anycast Station provides a built-in Streaming Encoder and a Streaming Server. The Streaming Encoder function allows the high-quality program output of the Anycast Station to be streamed in real-time - with minimum degradation and through very simple procedures - for distribution over the Internet, LANs, or private lines. When the number of clients is relatively small, the built-in Streaming Server function allows the streamed video to be distributed right from the Anycast Station without the need of an external streaming server connection.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[Digital Hybrid Wireless combines digital audio with an analog FM radio link to provide outstanding audio quality and the extended operating range of the finest analog wireless systems. 
<P>
The UH400A is a digital hybrid synthesized UHF plug-on transmitter compatible with all receivers in the 400, 200 and 100 Series product groups. A unique multi-voltage phantom power feature allows the transmitter to be used with any microphone, including high current condenser types, expanding its usefulness in high-end applications such as motion picture production.

The transmitter provides 256 frequencies in standard Lectro frequency blocks, selected with two rotary switches on the side of the housing.  The input amplifier uses an ultra low noise op-amp for quiet operation. It is gain controlled with a wide range dual envelope limiter which cleanly limits input signal peaks over 30 dB above full modulation.  A 24-bit A-D converter digitizes the audio, then filters supersonic audio above 21 kHz.  The RF transmission is an optimized FM system with +/-75 kHz wide deviation for a high signal to noise ratio.

<B>Features Include:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Converts microphones with XLR jacks to wireless operation
<LI>Selectable 5, 15 and 48 volt phantom power plus off position
<LI>256 synthesized UHF frequencies

		<description><![CDATA[The Spider Pod, a portable tripod riser and standing platform, elevates a camera tripod and operator two feet. It is designed for professional videographers and filmmakers, and news crews who need to raise their camera's viewpoint, yet do it with speed and stability. The Spider Pod allows a camera operator to shoot above crowds and capture images that are stable and unobstructed.

Large staging risers are often used as camera platforms. However, as an operator shifts footing, the camera and tripod may shake producing an unstable video image. When multiple shooters are on these shaky staging risers or camera are zoomed in, the problem is magnified. The Spider Pod features a separate tripod riser and standing platform eliminating camera shake caused by the camera operator.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The palm-sized Z90 gives you the flexibility of variable color temperature and access to any color of the rainbow at the touch of a button - all without gels or filters! Lighting professionals will love the Z90's ability to instantly switch between fully calibrated Daylight and Tungsten, with no color shift while dimming.

Tricky on-location lighting situations are quickly mastered with the Z90's adjustable 2500degK-9000degK color temperature and variable ± GREEN color correction. The easy to use built-in controls and digital display make set-up fast, with user-defined presets for storing your favorite settings

The Z90's wide 130deg spread means one Z90 will easily do the job of two or more inferior bulb-type LED lights.

Plus ZyLink technology allows you to wirelessly link together multiple Zylights to create a soft LED source as large as you need. Zylights that are linked together act in concert as if they were one unified LED source, with adjustments made on one light changing all lights in the group. Now that's cool.

You can easily control the Z90's output by snapping on the Accessory Adapter, allowing you to easily mount any standard 3-inch lighting accessory you may already have, such as barndoors or a snoot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The PMW-EX3 follows on from the successful launch of the new PMW-EX1 and offers all the great features of the PMW-EX1 in a new semi-shoulder design. In addition to this new design the camcorder also features an interchangeable lens system, genlock, timecode and remote control capability for real added flexibility, offering a low-cost HD studio solution.

The PMW-EX3 combines a state-of-the-art, non-linear XDCAM workflow with simply the best HD quality yet seen in a semi-shoulder camcorder. It is also the first semi-shoulder camcorder to carry the legendary CineAlta 24P brand with multiple frame rate recording capability such as 59.94i, 50i, and native 23.98P, as well being 1080i/720P switchable.

There is also a choice of a 35Mb/s High Quality mode or a 25Mb/s, HDV 1080i compatible mode. To take advantage of this high performance recording capability, the PMW-EX3 uses the same imaging system as the PMW-EX1, consisting of three 1/2-inch type CMOS sensors, each with an effective pixel count of 1920x1080. In addition, there's a purpose-built interchangeable Fujinon Professional HD 1/2-inch 14x lens and a unique dual focus ring mechanism. Included in the package is a 1/2-inch lens adaptor to allow use of other 1/2-inch lenses, plus the ability to use other optional lens adaptors for 2/3rd-inch, cinema-style and digital SLR lenses.

To maximise recording time, the PMW-EX3 has two memory card slots which means with a pair of 16 GB SxS PRO memory cards, it can record up to 140 minutes of HD footage.

A wide variety of accessories are also available, including a USB Reader/Writer, a wide-conversion lens, battery and charger.

The PMW-EX3 HD compact camcorder is the ideal solution for a wide range of customers from broadcasters through to independent videographers and film makers who want exceptional HD picture quality and state-of-the-art workflow from an affordable semi-shoulder camcorder.]]></description>

The cam-type focus mechanism allows for smooth focus adjustments. Modular construction increases ease of maintenance and serviceability.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Optical Design     The optics are designed to give maximum performance at full aperture with superior control of flare, distortion and spherical aberration. /i Electronics	   Accessible via cable connector near the lens mount and contacts in mount that sync with /i compatible cameras. Colour Balance	   All Cooke S4 prime lenses are colour balanced to a specification within parameters approved by Kodak. T2 Aperture	   All Cooke S4 primes have a true T2 aperture and cover Super 35mm format. Index Marks	   Every index mark is labeled. More detailed markings allow for more detailed focus control. Focus Movement	   Our Academy Award winning cam-style focus movement coupled with the added benefit of a large lens barrel diameter, has allowed for an increased number of focus markings, particularly at close focus. Spherical aberration has been controlled throughout the range of focal lengths to eliminate compensation of changes in back focus with aperture. A four-point contact bearing provides a smooth positive backlash-free movement. Camera Mounts	   Arriflex PL Mount Focus Scaling	   Large, clear numerals on both sides of the focus barrel benefit the focus puller when shooting under difficult lighting conditions. Compatibility	   All Cooke S4 primes have a common fixed front diameter of 110mm, (except for 12mm, 150mm, 180mm, 300mm) with a focus drive gear of 140T x 0.8 mod and an iris drive gear of 114T x 0.8 External Finish	   A scratch resistant PTFE hard anodized finish is provided on all Cooke lenses, providing a durable, hard-wearing surface to meet the most demanding environmental conditions.

Well-balanced Compact Body: The PDW-F800 is designed to be very compact and ergonomically well balanced, providing a high level of mobility and comfort in various shooting situations.

Optical ND Filters and CC Filters:	Neutral Density (ND) optical filter and CC filter are controlled via a built-in filter wheels.

Gain Control:	Gain Control (-6db to +42dB) and Turbo Gain “Shockless gain control” provides a smooth transition in gain control

3.5-inch* Widescreen: An easy-to-view color LCD screen provided on the camcorder side panel enables advanced operations such as Thumbnail Search and Scene Selection. Status indicators such as four-channel audio meters, and disc and battery remaining time can also be displayed. Camera set-up menus can be displayed, too. *Viewable area measured diagonally.

Slow shutter:	A maximum of 64 frames can be accumulated using the slow shutter function. In low light levels this allows clear video to be shot, and provides a fantasy video effect with ghost image. - 1-8, 16, 32 and 64 frame accumulation - Turbo Gain allows the camera gain to be boosted up to +48 dB.

Interval Recording:	The PDW-F800 offers an Interval Recording function which intermittently records signals at pre-determined intervals. This is convenient for shooting over long periods of time, and also when creating pictures with special effects of extremely quick motion.

Freeze Mix:	Superimposes a previously recorded image on the viewfinder. This allows the operator to quickly and easily frame or reposition a subject when a shot must be taken from the same position or in the same framework as a previous take.

Picture Cache Recording:	Maximum duration is 30sec. This picture cache mode can be ON even in EJECT operation and consequently sequential recording is possible during disc replacement.

Memory Stick® media:	“All file”, “Scene file”, “Lens file” and “User file” are provided to store the setting parameters to the internal memory and Memory Stick media.

Digital Extender:	The Digital Extender function of the PDW-F800 enables images to be digitally doubled in size. Unlike lens extenders, the Digital Extender function performs this capability without any loss of image sensitivity, which is often referred to as the F-drop phenomenon.

Focus magnification:	X2 magnified camera picture is available in the viewfinder which can help precise focus adjustment

Assignable switch:	PDW-F800 provides a total of 6 assignable switches (ASSIGN 1 to 4, COLOR TEMP, LENS RET)

Pool-feed Operation: For pool-feed operations, the optional CBK-HD01* and CBK-SC02* boards provide HD and SD-SDI inputs, and SD composite input respectively. *Planned to be available in fall 2008.

		<description><![CDATA[The Zaxcom ZFR100 is a timecode referenced audio recorder. The belt-pack style ZFR100 can be used in a sound bag, as a body worn recorder, or any other application that requires a high quality timecode stamped audio recording.
The STA-150 and STA-042 stereo adapters can be attached to the ZFR100. This sets it apart from the ZFR200 and ZFR300. The STA adaptors allow the ZFR100 to record a two analog or two digital line level signals, as well as giving you the option to externally power the ZFR100 from any DC source.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Fault tolerant recording Removable miniSD media Built-in time code reader / generator Small size & rugged design The ZFR100 features a fault tolerant recording system. If a memory card is ejected or accidentally turned off while recording there will be no audio loss prior to the point of interruption. The ZFR100 records on removable miniSD Flash media. Both record / stop and continuous loop recording is supported. The ZFR100 boasts a full-featured time code reader / generator with accuracy of 1 frame every 12 hours. The ZFR100 can auto-detect the time code frame rate when jammed. The ZFR100 operates using a single mic level unbalanced input with powering for lavaliere microphones. File transfer software that runs on both MAC and PC operating systems is included with the ZFR100. On the ZFR100 audio files are automatically recorded at 48 kHz / 24 bits. The transfer software utilizes sample rate conversion to obtain the sample rate and bit depth of choice when files are imported to your computer. There are two time code stamped file types to choose from: BWF (Broadcast Wave file) or MP3 file. MP3's are smaller files for transmission over the internet to a transcription house.]]></features>

Cooke S4 optics offer superb optical and mechanical performance, control of flare, distortion, veiling glare and spherical aberrations at full aperture. The cam-type focus mechanism allows for smooth focus adjustments. Modular construction increases ease of maintenance and serviceability. ]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Optical DesignThe optics are designed to give maximum performance at full aperture with superior control of flare, distortion and spherical aberration.
 ElectronicsAccessible via contacts in PL mount that sync with /i compatible cameras.
Colour BalanceAll miniS4/i prime lenses are colour balanced to a specification within parameters approved by Kodak.
ApertureAll miniS4/i primes have a true T2.8 aperture and cover Super 35mm format.
Index MarksEvery index mark is labelled. More detailed markings allow for more detailed focus control.
Focus MovementOur Academy Award® winning cam-style focus movement coupled with the added benefit of a large lens barrel diameter, has allowed for an increased number of focus markings, particularly at close focus. Spherical aberration has been controlled throughout the range of focal lengths to eliminate compensation of changes in back focus with aperture. A four-point contact bearing provides a smooth positive backlash-free movement.
Camera MountsArriflex PL Mount
Focus ScalingLarge, clear numerals on both sides of the focus barrel benefit the focus puller when shooting under difficult lighting conditions. Plus the the Entrance Pupil position is engraved on the lens.
CompatibilityAll Cooke miniS4/i primes have a common fixed front diameter of 87mm, with a focus drive gear of 121T x 0.8 mod and an iris drive gear of 119T x 0.8.
External FinishA scratch resistant PTFE hard anodised finish is provided on all Cooke lenses, providing a durable, hard-wearing surface to meet the most demanding environmental conditions.
IrisAn eight-leaf linear module iris assembly is fitted into miniS4/i primes with an aperture range of T2.8 to T22.
Weight/Size RatioThe lenses are designed for all shooting applications, including handheld and Steadicam, providing comfortable balance ratio with the latest compact cameras.

		<description><![CDATA[Based on the BT-LH1700W, which has long been popular for its versatility in both studio and field applications, the BT-LH1760 provides even better image quality and performance in a 17" LCD monitor for broadcast use. Double-speed (120 Hz/100 Hz) drive minimizes motion blur, and a new image processing engine with a three-dimensional LUT (Look Up Table) achieves faithful color reproduction.

Efficient broadcast and image production work is made possible by a host of powerful display functions, including a vectorscope, waveform monitor, cross hatch, pixel-to-pixel, HV delay, monochrome mode, split screen, audio level meter, time code, and closed caption display. With power consumption current operating on AC power reduced by 50%, and the quiet operation of its fanless drive, the BT-LH1760 is ideal for use in editing studios]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Double-Speed Drive for Blur-Free Moving Images 
Moving images without any motion blur are achieved by driving at a speed (120 Hz/100 Hz) that is twice the panel speed and inserting a black frame of a certain level between frames. Unlike frame creation methods, this system minimizes afterimages while displaying images faithful to the input signal. This high-performance, high-speed image display function is ideal for broadcast applications.

Faithful Color Reproduction 
The BT-LH1760 features a new image processing engine. By using a three-dimensional LUT (Look Up Table) for each RGB color and applying precise 10-bit image processing, it achieves faithful color reproduction from low to high brightness levels in all video formats.

Versatile Display Performance and Functions

Advanced image-enhancing circuitry, including excellent motion response and a diagonal line compensation circuit.
Wide, 176° horizontal and vertical viewing angle.
Marker and blue-only functions.
Vectorscope (SDI-In only) and waveform monitoring.
Cross hatch overlay display.
Pixel-to-pixel display without resizing HD pixels.
HV delay display and monochrome mode.
Coordination of multiple cameras on split screens.
Time code (SDI-In) and closed caption [Video (NTSC) input Only] display.
Cine-gamma (F-REC) compensation for Varicam shooting.
Audio level meter overlay display (with SDI input).
Low Current Consumption, Fanless Drive 
The consumption current of the new BT-LH1760 operating on AC power is about 50% lower than our previous model. And when no signal is received for 60 continuous seconds, the Power Save mode is activated to further minimize power consumption. This enables fanless drive, for a level of quiet operation that makes this model ideal for use in editing studios and Mastering rooms.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The HU3 gives focus pullers not only a robust and reliable unit but one whose controls equip the focus puller to smoothly translate the changing actors' positions on set to a precise movement of the focus knob. It integrates its 30 channel 2.4GHz wireless link into a new splash-resistant housing. Weather sealed tactile switches are used throughout. The integrated microwave antenna is protected from impact. The iris slider uses a unique non contact technology to eliminate the opening required for a conventional sliding seal. 
Generation 4 (G4) transceivers address the challenges brought about by the proliferation of wireless devices using the 2.4 GHz wireless band. Their new architecture results in a greatly improved ability to reject interference from other devices operating in the same band as well as out of band interference. The improvement in performance is quite significant, typically 10x or better interference rejection than previous transceivers. In addition, their lower power consumption doubles the operating time of the HU3 on battery power compared to its predecessor. 
The Motor Driver MDR2 accepts commands from the Hand Units connected via the wireless microwave link or cable, and controls up to three digital motors as well as camera functions for both film and video cameras. In addition, it allows wireless control of both the camera frame rate and shutter angle when used in conjunction with the F/X box. ]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[Selectable format and bit rates
A choice of bit rate is offered – either 35 Mbps (HQ mode) or 25 Mbps (SP mode) – depending on the desired picture quality and recording time. The camcorder records 1920 x 1080 HD images using the MPEG-2 Long GOP codec, which conforms to the MPEG-2 MP@HL compression standard.
Multiple-format recording 1080/720 and interlace/progressive switchable operation
The camcorder offers a wide array of recording formats for multiple content-creation applications. The recording mode is switchable between 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720, and 1440 x 1080 resolution. The scanning system is also selectable from interlace and progressive, such as 59.94i, 50i, 59.94p, and 50p.
Three Exmor Full-HD CMOS sensors
The PMW-320 is equipped with three Exmor CMOS sensors, which deliver superb picture performance with full-HD resolution. The PMW-320 has a 1/2-inch-type image sensor, which provides an excellent sensitivity of F10, a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio of 54dB and high horizontal resolution of 1,000 TV lines in HD-SDI, HQ 1080 mode. This high-performance sensor results in high-quality digital signals with extremely low noise. This significantly enhances shooting in low-light environments. Additionally, the large sensor can capture images with a shallower depth of field, giving users more freedom of creative expression.
Impressive body design
Designed to be very compact and ergonomically well balanced, the PMW-320 provides a high level of mobility and comfort in various shooting situations. The camcorder has a low centre of gravity, ensuring outstanding stability on the shoulder. The low-profile design provides a wide space between the main frame of the camera and the handle, and an unobstructed view to the right-hand side of the camera operator. The position of the shoulder pad can be adjusted to provide users with optimum weight balance even if the camera is docked with any type of lens or camera adaptor.
Low power consumption
For the PMW-320, power consumption is only 18 W* and can operate for approximately 310 minutes on a fully charged BP-GL95 battery pack.

* With supplied viewfinder, lens, and microphone while recording.
Lens package choice
The PMW-320K comes equipped with an HD lens with a standard bayonet interface. The lens is equipped with two independent focus wheel mechanisms, which can be switched between Auto Focus mode and Full Manual Focus mode by sliding the focus ring itself back and forth. The MF Assist function helps to precisely focus on the target subject when shooting in MF mode. In this mode, Auto Focus is momentarily activated when the user stops adjusting the focus ring.
ALAC (Automatic Lens Aberration Compensation)
This feature decreases any chromatic aberration caused by the lens. ALAC is activated only with the supplied lens and with certain third-party lenses that incorporate compensation data. (Please check with other lens manufacturers for ALAC support).
23.98p native recording
The PMW-320 offers a native 23.98p* recording capability. This feature, accompanied by other creative features, makes the camcorder ideal for cinema production.

* In 1440x1080/23.98p (SP) mode, images are handled as 23.98p and recorded as 59.94i signals via 2-3 pull-down.
Slow & Quick Motion function
The PMW-320 offers a Slow & Quick Motion function that enables users to create unique ‘looks’ by slow- and fast-motion effects. The camcorder can capture images at frame rates selectable from 1 frame per second (fps) to 60 fps in 720p mode and from 1 fps to 30 fps in 1080p mode, in increments of 1 fps. For example, when viewed at 23.98p, images captured at 60 fps appear two-and-a-half times slower than normal. Conversely, images captured at 4 fps appear six times faster than normal. With this function, images are recorded natively with no padded frames and at full resolution.
Slow Shutter function
The maximum accumulation period is at a 64-frame shutter speed.
Selectable gamma curves
The PMW-320 offers a wide variety of gamma curves to flexibly handle contrast, and give a specific ‘look’ to an image. In addition to six types of standard gamma curves, there are four types of Hyper Gamma which are identical to those on high-end CineAlta™ camcorders.
Interval Recording function
The Interval Recording function intermittently records one frame at pre-determined intervals. This is convenient for shooting over long periods of time, and also when creating special effects with extremely rapid motion.
Frame Recording function
The Frame Recording function is particularly useful for clay animation shooting.
ATW (Auto Tracing White Balance) and Hold
The Auto Tracing White Balance function automatically adjusts the camera’s colour temperature according to changes in lighting conditions. If required, the user can hold auto tracing at a desired colour balance via an assignable switch.
Image Inverter
With a DOF (Depth of Field) adaptor to attach a cinema or still camera lens to the camera, the image is rotated 180 degrees. This Image Inverter function normalises the image by reverse scanning.
Turbo gain
The gain can be chosen from a wide range of preset values between -3 dB and +24 dB.
DVCAM recording and playback
To realise smooth migration from current SD operation to near-future HD operation, the PMW-320 supports DVCAM format recording and playback as the standard function.
Picture Cache Recording
With the Picture Cache Recording function, up to 15 seconds of audio and video signals are buffered into the camcorder’s internal memory even before the record start button is pressed. This helps to prevent loss of any unexpected yet important events.
Freeze Mix function
The Freeze Mix function superimposes a previously recorded image on the viewfinder. This allows the operator to quickly and easily frame or reposition a subject when a shot must be taken from the same position, or in the same framework, as a previous take.
Four-channel audio
The PMW-320 comes equipped with four channels of 16-bit, 48-kHz, linear PCM uncompressed audio recording. Each channel level can be controlled individually.
Scene File system
The Scene File feature allows camera operators to easily call up customised picture-tonal settings – such as the parameters of matrix, detail, gamma, and knee – to suit particular shooting conditions. This gives users greater operational efficiency. SxS memory cards can be used for storing and loading scene files.
Viewfinder with 3.5-inch* colour LCD
The PMW-320 has a large, easy-to-view, colour LCD with a high resolution of 1920 x 480 pixels, which simplifies focusing. The viewfinder can also be used to instantly review recorded footage, as well as access and view the camera’s set-up menus, thumbnails, and status indications. The camcorder also has an interface for the DXF-20W, DXF-51, and DXF-C50W**.

* Viewable area measured diagonally.

** The supplied viewfinder and DXF viewfinder cannot be used concurrently.
HDMI connector
The PMW-320 is equipped with an HDMI connector.
50-pin interface and Digital Extender function
The CBK-CE01, a 50-pin interface option, offers a Digital Extender* function, which digitally doubles images in size. Unlike lens extenders, this function virtually does not lose image sensitivity, often referred to as the F-drop phenomenon.

* The Digital Extender function can not operate with Slow & Quick function.
Camera adaptor for multi-camera operation
The CBK-CE01 also offers the PMW-320 connection to the XDCA-55, camera adaptor. This newly-designed camera adaptor and the XDCU-50, Camera Extension Unit enable control of the camcorders from a distance of 100 m, and expands the potential of these camcorders for multi-camera operation.
Affordable MPEG TS Option for field and satellite transmission
The HDCA-702 MPEG TS adaptor, which can be directly docked onto the PMW-320, transmits an MPEG Transport Stream (TS) of MPEG via a DVB-ASI output. This function also requires the CBK-CE01.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The Phantom Flex offers an unprecedented degree of flexibility in all areas of high-speed image capture, and goes beyond HD to support 4-megapixel imaging, when the highest resolution is required. Depending on the shooting mode and resolution, the Flex is capable of shooting from 5 fps to over 10,750 fps.

The Phantom Flex offers two user-selectable shooting modes, each adapted to a particular shooting environment. In Standard Mode, the Phantom Flex is just like any other Phantom digital high-speed camera. Shoot at resolutions up to 2560x1600 pixels at anywhere from 10 frames-per-second up to 1,455 frames-per-second (fps). Maximum speed increases as the resolution decreases – up to 2,570 fps at 1920x1080, 5,350 fps at 1280x720, and 10,750 fps at 640x480.

In Phantom HQ Mode, Vision Research's proprietary image enhancement technology results in electronic image stability unprecedented in digital high-speed cameras: stable blacks, low noise, higher dynamic range, and repeatable shots over the full range of supported resolutions, frame rates and temperatures without the need for pre-shot black references. Maximum frame rates in HQ mode are about half those in Standard mode, which means that in HQ Mode Flex captures images at speeds up to 1,275 fps at 1920x1080 or 2,640 fps at 1280x720.

The Phantom Flex supports multiple workflows: a raw digital workflow, a video workflow, or combination of both for maximum control and flexibility.

With a video workflow, the Flex offers a video signal on the dual-link HD-SDI ports independent of the camera resolution. Set the resolution to 2560x1440 (16:9), and the camera will automatically scale the oversampled image when rendering the video signal. This technique increases the dynamic range and decreases noise in the video signal.

The Phantom Flex accepts a wide range of industry standard lenses. 35mm (PL, Canon EOS, Nikon F Panavision), Super16m and 2/3" lenses are all compatible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >To meet user demands for a fast EF-S zoom lens, Canon has specially designed a new lens with a large aperture of f/2.8 for select Canon Digital SLR cameras.* The large circular aperture produces a shallow depth-of-field, creating background blur that draws attention to the photographic subject. The lens construction includes UD and aspherical elements, which deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. Image Stabilizer lens groups shift to compensate for camera movement so that the image appears steady on the image plane, ensuring clear, crisp images, even in dim light. With a Ring-type USM, inner focusing and new AF algorithms, this lens achieves autofocus quickly and quietly, and with full-time mechanical manual focusing, manually adjusting the focus is possible even in AF mode.</SPAN>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS UM lens is its first mid-telephoto macro lens to include Canon's sophisticated Image Stabilization. With the highest quality optics available, combined with near-silent Ultrasonic focusing and life-size close-up capabilities without an adapter, the EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM is simply unrivalled.

This is the first lens on the market to incorporate Canon's new Hybrid Image Stabilization Technology. Hybrid IS effectively compensates for both angular and shift camera shake during close-up shooting. The lens was developed to expand users' photographing range and allow a wider range of users to easily enjoy macro photography.

		<description><![CDATA[Ultra-wide angle lenses have always been in demand by architectural, corporate, and other top pro photographers. This new lens features completely redesigned optics including 2 high-precision Aspherical elements and two totally new UD-glass elements. The result is superior image quality: better contrast and sharpness at the outer edges, and a reduction in chromatic aberrations that can sometimes be seen with high-resolution digital SLRs. Its diagonal angle of view is an impressive 114°-anything larger would be a Fisheye lens. It has a built-in lens hood, and has been dust- and moisture- proofed. The lens uses a rear focusing system, high-speed CPU, and a powerful ring-type USM with revised electronics for faster, more responsive AF. This lens continues the proud tradition of superior clarity optics found in L-series Canon lenses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Canon's newest fixed length L-series lens, the EF 24mm f/1.4L II USM, incorporates the newest in Canon lens technology for spectacular sharpness and impressive performance at all settings. It features two high-precision, large-diameter aspherical lenses for sharpness across the sensor, even in peripheral areas of full-frame sensors. Lens elements have a newly-designed anti-reflective SWC (Sub Wavelength Coating) that departs from conventional coatings by using an extremely fine structure that minimizes ghosting and flaring across the lens surface, regardless of the angle with which light enters or exits. It also features two UD lens elements to minimize chromatic aberrations, incorporates rear-focusing, ultrasonic, quiet and high-speed AF with full-time manual override. A circular aperture provides beautiful out-of-focus detail and offers legendary dust- and water-resistant L-series construction using only lead-free glass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The EF 50mm f/1.2L USM Lens  is a fast prime lens featuring a particularly large maximum aperture for effective low-light and shallow depth of field capability. As a standard focal length lens, it is suitable for most any shooting situation and its lens coating and optical construction are optimized to minimize chromatic aberrations, ghosting and flare. A truly circular diaphragm results in pleasing out-of-focus areas.

An ultrasonic autofocus motor (USM) provides fast, smooth and quiet autofocus action and manual focus override allows for precise manual focusing even in AF mode. With a tight seal structure and the addition of the optional Canon protect filter, the 50mm f/1.2L lens is moisture and dust proof.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The LAMBDA is a NODAL SWING HEAD ideally suited for 35MM film cameras fully equipped with long lenses, mattebox and extra large film magazines.
Providing a high level of operational flexibility, this Fluid Head can be easily fitted to a wide range of supports including tripods, dollies, cranes and camera cars. The mounting can be inverted in under-slung position for low line positioning and allow the camera to be moved all the way to the ground and provide for accurate images which normally cannot be obtained with other traditional supports.
<p>
The balance system is designed so that the camera may swing on its center of gravity and rotate 360° on its vertical axis. No springs or similar counter reaction elements are required to set the head in a fixed tilt position and fluid pan and tilt movements have the same identical feel. The lens focal distance can be kept constant by presetting the fore and aft horizontal sliding plate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These HMI units combine the variable beam spread of a Fresnel fixture and the light output of a PAR fixture. They use a unique mulit-faceted reflector that eliminates the need for spread lenses. These powerful units in various power classes produce a shadow quality that is crisp, clean and sharp.
<p>
Based on the design principles of the ARRIMAX, the M18 is an innovative lamphead that works with a new power class of lamp: the 1800W SE HMI™. This lamp boasts 750 hours of average life and a Luminous Efficacy of 92 Lumens per Watt (L/W). The Color Rendering Index (Ra) is greater than 90 at 6000K (CCT).
<p>
Now the "Brightest HMI you can plug into the wall,"* the M18 is a lensless, open face lighting fixture that combines the desired light distribution from the optics of a PAR and a Fresnel fixture. The unique ARRIMAX reflector design creates diverging rays to produce a crisp shadow.
<p>
With a beam angle (HPA) of 20 to 60 degrees and a wide usable field angle, the M18 is designed to be both intense, efficient, highly versatile and meet better lighting efficiencies in a new performance class. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This easy-to-use standard zoom lens can cover a large zoom area ranging from 24mm wide-angle to 105mm portrait-length telephoto, and its Image Stabilizer Technology steadies camera shake up to three stops. Constructed with one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses, this lens minimizes chromatic aberration and distortion. 
<p>
The result is excellent picture quality, even at wide apertures. Canon's ring-type USM gives silent but quick AF, along with full-time manual focus. Moreover, with dust- and moisture-resistant construction, this is a durable yet sophisticated lens that meets the demands of advanced amateur photographers and professional photographers alike.]]></description>

The AVC-Intra codec is unrivaled for its full-raster, 10-bit, 4:2:2 sampling with none of the inherent compromises of 8-bit, long GOP and 4:2:0 recording. The HPX370 provides the ultra reliability of a solid-state design and the faster speed of a file-based workflow.

The HPX370 utilizes a 20-bit digital signal processor and high-resolution 3-MOS imagers, enhanced with U.L.T., which boosts the sensors' performance to rival the image quality and sensitive of ½" imagers. The new U.L.T. sensor results in marked improvements in sensitivity, measured at F10. These high levels of sensitivity and image quality have been achieved with a new high-sensitivity photodiode and low-noise pixel transistor, both based on low-noise analog process technology. The same levels of sensitivity and image production that characterize the interlace mode are now possible in the progressive mode courtesy of Progressive Advanced Processing (P.A.P.), a 3D adaptive processing technology.

With the flexibility of an interchangeable lens, the HPX370 can be used with 1/3" to 2/3" lens adapters for use with existing 2/3" zoom and prime lenses. The camera offers a broad range of creative features including variable frame rates, advanced gamma functions including a new Cine film-like gamma, Chromatic Aberration Compensation (CAC), built-in scan reverse, Dynamic Range Stretch (DRS) function, waveform and vector scope display and focus assist tools. The HPX370 also comes equipped with flash band detection and compensation software built-in for improved CMOS performance.]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[The NEX-FS100UK is includes a Sony 18 ~200mm E-Mount lens. Sony's E-mount interchangeable lenses feature precision-crafted optics with aspherical glass elements for compact high performance, and circular iris mechanisms for smooth background defocusing. The supplied SEL18200(E 18–200mm F3.5–6.3 OSS) with the NEX-FS100UK boasts 11x zoom power, a quiet AF motor for cleaner sound recording, and Optical SteadyShot™ image stabilization with an advanced Active mode that lets you take steady handheld shots while walking around — even without a bulky stabilization rig.
Equipped with a large CMOS sensor equivalent in size to Super35mm film like that used in the PMW-F3, it is able to create a rich bokeh effect (beautifully defocused image) to produce the much-desired shallow-focus look associated with top-shelf commercials and feature films. The sensor also features the optimum number of effective pixels for shooting HD moving images. This new sensor is designed with outstanding exposure latitude and sensitivity to deliver extraordinary HD images subtle in detail and color gradation while avoiding image artifacts typical of HDSLRs.. A tape measure hook and an image sensor position index on the body marks the position of the focal plane.
35mm E-Mount Interchangeable Lens System. The NXCAM Super35 features a Sony E-mount Interchangeable lens system. Due to the adoption of the E-mount interchangeable lens system, a great variety of current and future E-mount lenses from various lens manufacturers (Sony Zeiss, Tamron, Sigma and Cosina) are compatible. Thanks to its unusually shallow flange focal distance virtually any 35mm lens can be mounted via third-party adaptors. Furthermore, with the optional Sony LA-EA 2mount adaptor you can take advantage of the abundant “α” A-mount lenses.
1920x1080P Slow and Quick Motion (Over & Under Cranking). Recording images at a different frame rate from that used for playback provides the extra versatility of slow and quick motion shooting. The NEX-FS100 enables Full HD (1920×1080) progressive slow and quick motion. S&Q shooting plus last scene review permits checking the S&Q effects on-set, immediately after shooting the scene without drilling down menus.
Build-up modular design. Featuring a compact, lightweight body with detachable grip, handle, and viewfinder tube, the NXCAM Super35 can be configured for a wide range of shooting situations. To facilitate hand-held shooting, the angle of the handgrip can be positioned 360 degrees as desired and the LCD Panel can rotate for left or right side operation. Furthermore, there are numerous 1/4- and 3/8-inch screw holes on both the handle and the camera body for mounting the camera or attaching various peripheral devices.
Sharp, large and bright 3.5 XtraFine™ LCD/ View finder. Located on the optical axis, the 3.5-inch-type XtraFine LCD panel enables easier, more intuitive framing, especially during hand-held shooting. And the LCD panel can be rotated for stress-free operation from either side of the camera. For easier, more precise focusing, a large Viewfinder tube with 1.2x magnifier is supplied to convert the LCD into a superb viewfinder.
Flexible recording media. Recording to the directly mountable HXR-FMU128 Flash Memory unit allows continuous recording for over 10 hours without changing the recording medium. Simultaneous recording using memory cards and other media is also possible for secure backup when shooting footage that can't be reshot.
HDMI Output with Embedded Time code for 4:2:2 Uncompressed digital output. For extra convenience when using external recorders, the NEX-FS100 provides an HDMI Output with Embedded Time code and pull down markers Signal Output al Output.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon XF305 Professional Camcorder features 50Mbps MPEG-2 4:2:2 recording to Compact Flash (CF) cards for unsurpassed image quality and efficient, robust workflow at an affordable price. It is ideally suited to match the requirements of electronic news gathering (ENG) crews, independent filmmakers, documentary producers, event videographers and military agencies.

Utilizing file-based MPEG-2 compression with an MXF File Wrapper ensures the widest compatibility with existing industry infrastructure, metadata and non-linear editing (NLE) systems. And 4:2:2 color sampling provides ultra-fine transitions in tone and color for maintaining the highest quality image for use in advanced post production.

A newly developed Genuine Canon 18x HD L-Series lens along with three Canon native 1920 x 1080 CMOS Image Sensors delivers pristine image quality.

Incorporating industry-standard HD-SDI output, genlock input and SMPTE time code input/output terminals makes the Canon XF305 perfectly matched for live application and multi-camera shooting.

The XF305 also offers multiple recording bit rates, resolutions and variable frame rates to expand your creative flexibility, and allow you to work in virtually any production environment. And complete customization over the image, display and operation makes the XF305 a camcorder that can be tailored to fit your individual needs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sound Devices PIX 240 video recorder adds Quicktime recording using Apple ProRes or Avid DNxHD to any HDMI-or HD-SDI equipped high-definition video camera. The portable PIX 240 (HDMI and HD-SDI) record Quicktime files to CompactFlash cards or removable 2.5-inch solid-state hard drives.
<p>
Apple ProRes and Avid DNxHD video formats have emerged as industry standards. These I-frame codecs offer the best in picture quality, processing efficiency, and data storage requirements. They are ideal for editing, on-the-fly color grading, and video processing. Files recorded in the field on a PIX recorder are ready for the most popular editorial workflows.
<p>
Supporting HD-SDI and HDMI v1.3 input signals up to 1080i/p, the recorder provides simultaneous HD-SDI and HDMI outputs. It includes a tunable highly accurate time code generator and reader with genlock output which offers proper synchronization between the input and outputs. Based on 7-series digital audio recorders, the recorder features high-bandwidth inputs that are mic/line switchable and include limiters, high-pass filters, and 48V phantom power for high quality audio with low-noise. It supports AES3 digital audio using 2 XLR connectors which are capable of accepting up to 4 digital audio inputs. In addition, the PIX 240 includes an external eSATAp connector for direct, powered connection to large SATA storage volumes.
<P>
The PIX 240 offers powerful, hardware-based video scalers. Realtime conversion among video formats, including 1080i, 1080p, and 720p, are set with a simple menu selection. Conversion between interlaced and progressive, as well as frame rate conversion is available in realtime. For instance, some cameras set to record 24ps send 1080i 60 over HDMI or HD-SDI. PIX recorders can be set to convert the 1080i 60 stream back to 24p with no loss in quality.
<p>
The PIX 240 includes a 5” LCD display which displays images with 800 x 480 resolution and provides immediate confirmation of recording, playback, audio metering, and setup menu selections. It supports input audio source selection between embedded HDMI, embedded HD-SDI, or balanced audio and features a LANC connector for connection with a LANC controller for control over start and record options. Featuring FireWire 800 and USB 3.0 (USB 2.0 backward-compatible) connectors, the PIC-Caddy also includes an eSATAp connection which offers drive powering and 3 Gb/s transfer rate over a single cable.
<p>
HDMI input accepts (480i, 525i, 720p, 1080i, 1080p)
<BR>
HD-SDI input accepts (480i, 525i, 720p, 1080i, 1080p)

		<description><![CDATA[The ARRILITE 750 Plus is a new and improved incarnation of ARRI’s traditional, open-faced light, the ARRILITE 800/1000.

By optimizing the ARRIMAX reflector for usage with an 750W lamp, the ARRILITE 750 Plus offers 21 percent higher light efficiency than the previous ARRILITE 800W, while the ARRIMAX optical system improves distribution of the light. A detachable and fully rotatable accessory holder accommodates scrims and barndoors, and incorporates fittings that permit the Chimera Video Pro Plus S to be fitted directly, without an additional speedring.
The one-arm stirrup allows for plenty of pan-and-tilt options and a heat-proof handle at the rear of the lamphead enables easy maneuvering. No tools are required for changing bulbs as the housing consists simply of two detachable parts that open and close through bayonet cap locks. The smaller and lighter aluminum housing of the ARRILITE 750 Plus makes it an ideal lamphead for lighting kits and therefore also suitable for electronic newsgathering, field production and fast turnaround location use.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This high-performance, portable 9-inch LCD monitor with its new IPS LCD panel boasts best-in-class 1280 x 768 WXGA pixel resolution. Perfect for field and studio applications, the LH910 can be utilized on-camera as an electronic viewfinder, on location, in mobile vehicles or for live settings. With 176 degree vertical and horizontal viewing angles, the widest offered by any LCD display, the LH910 delivers exceptional imagery and superb color accuracy, and professional interfaces including HDMI and 3G-SDI.

The LH910 further demonstrates its versatility with 3D assist functions, including a 2X SDI IN overlay and side-by-side display to provide a 2D view of various 3D checks, including composition, convergence, color, luminance, focus, zoom, and parallax. These 3D assist functions are invaluable for production crews that require 3D review in the field when using a 3D rig system.

We found one feature very interesting - it can produce checkerboard display from two HD/SD SDI inputs. It can come handy, when matching the cameras. Just point them at the same chart and see how they differ.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Zephyr incorporates the same revolutionary features that previously won the coveted DV Professional Association’s “Best of Show” at NAB for Steadicam.

“Style, functionality,flexibility and affordability all wrapped within the new Steadicam Zephyr. A combination of innovative features derived from our popular PILOT, FLYER, and Archer 2 Steadicam systems now allows an excel in the range of operating possibilities,” said Frank Rush, Steadicam VP and General Manager, at The Tiffen Company. 
 

A new innovative approach to camera stabilizer design, the Steadicam Zephyr has a host of “future proof” features that allow it to be a versatile and an ever-evolving essential tool for camera stabilization needs. 

Features Include:

9 to 23lbs.(4 to 10.4kg) net camera weight
Adjustable Iso-Elastic Arm™
Telescopic carbon fiber post
Connector rich base and stage
Dual axis vernier adjustable stage
Unparalleled Inertial control and dynamically adjustable base
The new Zephyr vest design incorporates adjustable and pivoting shoulder buckles to assure a new comfort level for extended use.

New vest and pad covers are easily removed for cleaning or replacement offering extended durability.

The new tools-free patented Iso-Elastic™ stabilizer Zephyr Arm has been upgraded from the Steadicam FLYER and supports 23lbs (10.4kg) of payload weight. The no-tools Arm /Vest interface allows for quick customization to the individual operator. “On the fly” weight adjustment frees the operator from dismounting the system to make changes. The open design of the arm has freedom of movement unknown in this weight class. The Zephyr adjustable and interchangeable arm post assembly is a feature usually found on more expensive systems.

The new Steadicam Zephyr comes standard with a 7”, 16:9/4:3 composite NTSC/PAL LCD monitor , or optional 7” 16:9/4:3 HD/composite LCD monitor that features enhanced image quality and a wide viewing angle, even under bright sunlight making it ideal for field production use. Input configurations include: Analog NTSC/PAL Composite/S-Video/Component/RGB and HD/SDSDI (SMPTE-274M, 296M, 260M, 125M) with active loop through.

The Zephyr camera mounting stage was designed for enhanced mounting stability with standard HD and composite BNC video connectors, 2 x standard 3-pin LEMO power connectors and expandability ports for future accessories. The stage comes complete with a dual axis vernier adjustable mounting platform and extended camera mounting dovetail plate.

The Zephyr Sled Base features extendable rigid aluminum monitor and battery mounting rods, easily removable for compact storage or transport.  A single mounting rod release allows for quick set-ups and ease of dynamic and inertial adjustments.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three Aspherical lens elements, plus a Super-UD element, assure image quality. Its ring-type USM means fast and silent AF along with full-time manual focus. It focuses as close as 9.5 inches.

The Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM is an ultra wide-angle zoom lens with dynamic expressive capability for all EF-S mount digital EOS cameras, exceptionally small and lightweight for maximum mobility.

With an effective focal length range of approximately 16-35mm in 35mm format, this lens allows you to get extremely close to subjects, exaggerating the difference in size between a near object and its background. Creative photographers can use this phenomenon to create excellent separation between subject and background for a strong sense of presence, or for a pan-focus effect with everything from foreground to background sharply in focus.

Designed specifically for digital photography, the lens has specially shaped lens elements and Super Spectra coatings to suppress ghosting and flare, which can be caused by reflections off digital camera sensors. An exclusive optional lens hood can further reduce the incidence of flare.

Note: Not suitable for 35mm film SLR cameras or digital camera with image sensor bigger than APS-C size,.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To meet user demands for a fast EF-S zoom lens, Canon has specially designed a lens with a large aperture of f/2.8 for select Canon Digital SLR cameras. The large circular aperture produces a shallow depth-of-field, creating background blur that draws attention to the photographic subject. 
<p>
The lens construction includes UD and aspherical elements, which deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. Image Stabilizer lens groups shift to compensate for camera movement so that the image appears steady on the image plane, ensuring clear, crisp images, even in dim light. With a Ring-type USM, inner focusing and new AF algorithms, this lens achieves autofocus quickly and quietly, and with full-time mechanical manual focusing, manually adjusting the focus is possible even in AF mode.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This lens replaces the previous high quality L-series 28-70mm f/2.8 lens, with a lens of even greater caliber. The range has been extended to cover an ultra-wide angle of 24mm, which makes it ideal for digital as well as film shooters, and the optics are even better than before with two Aspherical elements and a totally new UD glass element. It's now sealed and gasketed against dust and moisture, and a new processing unit makes the AF faster than ever.

Internal Focusing
The internal focusing mechanism allows the front of the lens to remain stationary and to easily accommodate specialty filters, such as polarizing filters.

Two Aspherical Elements
A lens design incorporating elements ground so the curve of the surface does not describe an arc of a circle. Especially useful in reducing distortion in wide angle lenses.

UD Element
UD glass is one of the new technologies to open new possibilities to develop the zoom lenses with low weight and high optical performance. UD elements make it possible to correct chromatic aberrations whilst maintaining low weight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ARRI Fresnel series is ideal for use where compact, light weight tungsten Fresnel spotlights are required. Arri Fresnels are the perfect solution in small studios where grid height is a problem.

		<description><![CDATA[This ARRI Softbank IV 5 Light Kit includes barndoors, filter frames scrims, a softbox, clamps, light stands, bulbs, accessory kit, and a heavy duty wheeled case.
<p>
The ARRI 150W Fresnel is a compact, lightweight fixture with great performance, tough construction and a 2" Fresnel lens. Superior optical performance and ARRI's die cast aluminum housing make this the perfect small unit for hair light, edge light or eye light.
<p>
The ARRI 300W Plus Fresnel is designed to gather as much light as possible and direct it through the 3.2" low expansion, Fresnel lens producing a soft, even field of light. The beam spread is 15 - 55°
<p>
The 650W Fresnel features the same lens, reflector, housing and power cord as the 300W Fresnel. The beam angle in the flood position is 54°, and a narrow 13° in the spot position.
<p>
The ARRILITE 750 Plus from ARRI is an enhanced version of the tried-and-true ARRILITE open face line. ARRI started with the basic design of the ARRILITE 800 and optimized the reflector to increase output 21% using a 750W HPL lamp which employs a compact filament that concentrates and augments light while increasing efficiency. The result is almost double the output. A redesigned one-arm stirrup instead of a yoke facilitates greater movement while the dedicated accessory holder allows use of Chimera softboxes without a speed ring.

		<description><![CDATA[The Denecke TS-C is a compact full featured smart slate, capable of reading, generating and displaying SMPTE/EBU time code. Its new compact size makes the TS-C ideal for documentary work, insert shots, or anywhere a big slate is too cumbersome. 
<p>
The TS-C jams to all standard frame rates, including 23.976 for HD. The TS-C reads and displays off speed time code used in special situations such as music video playback. The time code reader mode works with both ascending and descending time code.  The TS-C is the first Denecke product to support Aaton serial communication! The precision TCXO combined with a 16 BIT microprocessor ensure extremely low drift and high accuracy. The standard EL backlit face plate is helpful in low light situations. The new Denecke TS-C compact slate is affordably priced. Your choice of black and white or color clapper sticks.]]></description>

Higher resolution means more critical attention to details such as sets, lighting, makeup, and the actual conveyance of the camera- herein lies the need for an especially smooth fluid head, such as the ULTIMATE 2060HD. Capable of supporting camera payloads up to 83.0 lbs (37.7 kg), none of the usual production-grade features are left out: dual adjustable pan arms, an interchangeable top stage, an interchangeable base, and threaded connection points for finder extensions and an assistant's box. As one might expect from a product of this caliber, the 2060HD carries an unbeatable 5-year warranty for parts and labor as well as friendly, accessible technical support. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 100 system uses 20 kHz wide deviation for a high signal to noise ratio. The transmitter circuits are all regulated to allow full output power from the beginning (9 Volts) to the end (6.5 Volts) of battery life. The input amplifier uses a Motorola 33078 op amp for ultra low noise operation. It is gain controlled with a wide range input compressor which cleanly limits input signal peaks over 30dB above full modulation.
<p>
<b>DUAL BAND COMPANDOR</b><br>
Traditionally, compandors have been a source of distortion in wireless microphone systems. The basic problem with conventional systems is that the attack and decay times are always a compromise. If the time constants are fast, high frequency transients will not be distorted, but this will cause low frequency distortion. If the time constants are slower, low frequency audio distortion will be low, but high frequency transients will then be distorted. The 100 system introduces an entirely new approach to solving this basic problem, called “dual-band companding.”
There are actually two separate compandors in the 100 system, one for high frequencies and one for low frequencies. A crossover network separates the frequency bands at 1 kHz with a 6 dB per octave slope, followed by separate high and low frequency compandors. The attack and release times in the high frequency compandor are fast enough to keep high frequency transient distortion at a low level, and the low frequency compandor uses slower time constants, reducing low frequency distortion to well below that of a conventional compandor.
<p>
<b>PRE-EMPHASIS/DE-EMPHASIS</b><br>
The signal to noise ratio of the 100 system is extended by using pre-emphasis (HF boost) in the transmitter and de- emphasis (HF roll off) in the receiver. Pre-emphasis and de-emphasis in an FM radio system usually provides about a 10 dB improvement in the signal to noise ratio of the system, but the high frequency boost in the transmitter must be removed in a purely complimentary manner or else the frequency response of the original audio signal will be altered. The dual-band compandor in the 100 system essentially provides a dynamic pre-emphasis/de-emphasis function with low distortion.
<p>
<b>LONG BATTERY LIFE</b><br>
High efficiency circuits throughout the design allow over 4.5 hours of operation using a single 9 Volt alkaline battery. (A 9V lithium battery will provide over 14 hours of operation.) The battery compartment is a unique mechanical design which automatically adjusts to fit any brand of battery. The battery contacts are spring loaded to prevent “rattle” as the unit is handled.
<p>
<b>FREQUENCY AGILITY</b><br>
The transmitter section uses a synthesized, frequency selectable main oscillator The frequency is extremely stable over a wide temperature range and over time.
Two rotary switches, located on the side panel of the unit, provide 256 frequencies in 100kHz steps over a 25.5MHz range. This alleviates carrier interference problems in mobile or travelling applications.
<p>
<b>ANTENNA</b><br>
At UHF frequencies, where wavelengths and antennas are shorter than at VHF frequencies, a resonant length wire is preferred over using the microphone cable as the antenna. The antenna on the UM100 consists of a flexible 1/4 wavelength bronze cable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[11-16mm f2.8 converted Tokina still lens with PL mount designed to cover a Super35 image.

Duclos Lenses has developed a conversion process for the Tokina 11-16mm ultra-wide angle lens.

Most obvious is the PL mount that interfaces with any PL mount camera including the RED One. More subtle yet most important is the activated manual aperture control. Lubricated, geared, and marked, the new aperture ring allows precise control for the user. The outer shell of the lens has been replaced with black anodized aluminum. Internal components are refined and reenforced. The final product is a small, lightweight lens perfectly capable of holding it’s own against the likes of other motion picture optics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Combined with the Sachtler™ Touch & Go automatic locking system, TANGO is the fastest third axis which is adaptable on any type of head.

Compared to his competitors TANGO enjoys a considerable advantage of being able to rotate on the optical axis allowing the camera to turn on its gravity center. The patented conception of TANGO includes small product-dimension. The thickness is only 2.3". Whatever head chosen, the panoramic movement remains horizontal and the tilt stays vertical. So you will realize that the maneuvering of the fluid or gear head remains unchanged. The twin support and racks add further advantages to TANGO such as silence and flexibility when moving, lightness and a locking position range of 90 degrees.

So, TANGO allows you to maintain the ability and security when moving your camera and using your favorite head and its three axes.

		<description><![CDATA[Measuring distance just became easier with the Cinematography Electronics CINE TAPE MEASURE System. This versatile ultrasonic system continuously calculates the distance between a subject and the camera's film-plane. By continuously measuring distance during a shot, small or subtle subject movements are no longer a problem. With non-stop measurements, focusing a camera lens is simplified which saves time, avoids retakes and reduces production costs.
<p>
The main components of our system are the CINE TAPE MEASURE CONTROL and the SENSOR ASSEMBLY. The control displays accurate distance measurements from the constant stream of data that is received by the sensors.
<p>
The CINE TAPE MEASURE System is a small, rugged, lightweight, and quiet ultrasonic range finder. It is compatible with all lenses, film cameras and video cameras. In addition, our system is easy to set up and use, making it the first choice of professional filmmakers.
<p>
]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[<p><b>Cine Tape Measure Control</b><br>
The stylish Cinematography Electronics CINE TAPE MEASURE CONTROL is the brain of the system. It continuously computes the distance between the camera's film plane and the subject. A simple one-time Film-Plane offset adjustment programs the relationship of the film plane to the sensor position. When the control detects a subject, the green Sense LED glows and the calculated distance is shown on the LED display in either feet-inches or meters-centimeters. Adjustable brightness levels for the large red LED display offers comfortable viewing under different lighting conditions. The digital Sensitivity adjustment feature fine-tunes the system range, which is also helpful with different subject reflectivity. The Close Focus feature sets the minimum sense distance. Objects within this area are disregarded. All of the functions are set and stored digitally, which safeguards against accidental changes and provides accurate repeatability between units.
<p><b>Sensor Assembly</b><br>
The innovative Cinematography Electronics SENSOR ASSEMBLY consists of two small cone-shaped "horns," a miniature pan tilt mechanism, a mounting stud, and an electrical connector. The horns send and receive ultrasonic signals that are used to calculate the distance measurement. Mounting the SENSOR ASSEMBLY onto a camera package is simple with the combo stud. With its pan and tilt adjust/lock knobs, aiming the horns towards the subject is quick and straightforward. The SENSOR ASSEMBLY interfaces to the control via a short detachable Sensor Cable. A spring-loaded holder permits laser pens to be attached parallel to the sensors, providing a visual reference during calibration.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[THE POWER-POD CLASSIC is an analogue robotic pan / tilt system with an established reputation for being one of the most versatile and reliable remote heads available in the film industry. It is the one that an operator would build himself - one that delivers exceptional performance and smooth response; one he knows he can trust.
<p>
The POWER-POD CLASSIC has a broad tolerance for off-balance loads. It can capture difficult shots in impractical or treacherous environments. With the crew at a safe distance, POWER-POD CLASSIC makes dangerous moves that would ordinarily be abandoned. When conditions are less than ideal, the POWER-POD CLASSIC System always delivers.
<p>
The Power-Pod Classic is suitable for camera payloads of 15lb-60lbs; ideal for use with cranes.  Remote head is controlled via cable up to 100’ through pan and tilt wheels a-la ‘gear-head wheels’ using video monitor for viewing and Preston Cinema System’s FI+Z for lens control.

		<features><![CDATA[MPEG-2 4:2:2 50 Mbps Codec (Canon XF Codec)

MPEG-2 compression is both highly reliable and versatile. Developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), it is one of the most widely used compression schemes in the industry for camera acquisition, over the air broadcast, cable and satellite TV. Canon’s adaptation of MPEG-2 for the XF300 Professional Camcorder, named the Canon XF Codec, ensures the widest compatibility with existing industry infrastructure and non-linear editing (NLE) systems. As well, by using an MXF file wrapper, video and audio can be wrapped in a single file along with important metadata.

The XF300 supports the highest HD quality with Full HD 1920x1080 resolution, up to 50Mbps bit rate and 4:2:2 color sampling.

4:2:2 color sampling provides twice the color resolution of HDV and other codecs that use 4:2:0 color sampling. 4:2:2 provides ultra-fine transitions in tone and color and maintains the highest quality image for use in post production processes such as chroma keying, color grading, advanced compositing and effects.

The codec’s 50Mbps constant bit rate provides the bandwidth needed to capture the XF300’s superior resolution and color in spectacular detail.

Record to Affordable Compact Flash Cards

Unlike other camcorders which use proprietary memory systems, the XF300 Professional Camcorder records to cost effective Compact Flash (CF) cards. The camcorder features two CF card slots and offers versatile recording functions including:

Relay recording:
When one CF card becomes full, the camcorder automatically switches video recording to the other CF card.
Hot swapping:
Media can be replaced without turning off the camcorder. And while recording, the other card can be removed without interruption.

File copy and backup:
Files may be copied from one card to the next – ideal for backing up when on location.
Pre Record:
Perfect for news crews and live event shooters, the camcorder continuously buffers approximately three seconds of video in memory. When the Record button is pressed, recording begins and the contents of buffer memory are added, so you never miss an important shot.

Genuine Canon 18x HD L-Series Lens

Inspired by the same high level of optical precision used in Canon broadcast and photographic lenses, the Canon XF300 Professional Camcorder incorporates a Genuine Canon 18x HD L-Series lens that features a wide and impressive zoom range of 29.3 – 527.4mm (35mm equivalent). The lens incorporates High Index – Ultra-low Dispersion (HI-UD), Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) and aspherical elements to minimize chromatic aberration while delivering a resolution of 1,000 TV lines.

In Full Manual Mode, the lens features mechanical stops for both the zoom and focus systems. Mechanical (Hard) end stops ensure that repeatable and dependable focus and zoom can be achieved when manually turning the lens barrel. These mechanical stops also allow for compatibility with many third-party remote camera controllers that require end stops in order to calibrate themselves. Additionally, display distance indicators on the lens barrel allow the operator to easily set the desired focus distance and move between focus points while recording.

For enhanced versatility and durability, the lens is equipped with three built-in glass, neutral density (ND) filters (¼, 1/16 and 1/64) and a six-blade metal aperture iris.

SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer
The XF300 also incorporates a newly designed SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization system (lens shift) with three modes: Standard, Dynamic and Powered.

Standard:
Lens shift is controlled so that the maximum compensation angle is constant from wide angle through telephoto.

Dynamic:
Stabilization changes throughout the zoom range to minimize more pronounced shaking. This is especially useful at wide-angle focal lengths when walking.

Powered:
Vibration is suppressed at the telephoto end of the range, where shake is most apparent due to high magnification.

Instant AF
When shooting high definition video, sharp focus becomes more critical than ever. Canon's proprietary Instant AF system combines an external AF sensor with Canon's legendary auto focus system for fast and accurate focus. Together, the two sensors reduce focusing time - even in low-light, low contrast, or high brightness situations - and improve focusing performance on difficult subjects.

The XF300 gives you a choice of two AF modes for different shooting applications:
Normal AF changes focus at a speed that appears natural and doesn't distract the viewer.
Instant AF changes focus as rapidly as possible and is designed for applications in which quick focus is more important than other considerations - for example, in news gathering or documentary work.

Optional Canon WA-H82 Wide Attachment (0.8X)
Optically matched for the XF300’s HD lens, the WA-H82 Wide Attachment increases wide angle capability to approximately 24mm (35mm equivalent), while maintaining the versatility of a 4X zoom range.
* Instant AF is not possible with the WA-H82.

30p Frame Rate
30p is the ideal frame rate for video viewed on the Internet. It is also an excellent choice for frame grabbing during playback.

24p Frame Rate
24p matches the frame rate of a traditional film camera giving the same cadence and temporal motion needed for a "film look."

Optional 50i/50p/25p Frame Rate Upgrade
For added versatility, XF300 can be customized to record in both 60i/50i, 60p/50p, and 24p/25p (this optional upgrade must be performed by a Canon Factory Service Center).

Slow Motion & Fast Motion
Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the XF300 to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate, resulting in either a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camera is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained.

In 1080 mode, fast motion is supported up to 2.5x the normal rate and as slow as 1/2.5x. In 720 mode, fast motion is supported up to 5x the normal rate and as slow as 1/1.25x.

Interval Recording
With this feature, users can program the camera to record a specified number of frames at specified intervals. The technique can be used to observe natural phenomena over extended periods, making it ideal for time-lapse applications. The interval can be set in 25 levels ranging from 1 second to 10 minutes.
60i/30p: Selectable between 1, 3, 6 and 9 frames
24p/60p: Selectable between 2, 6 and 12 frames

Frame Recording
This setting allows a specified number of frames to be recorded – ideal for projects such as clay animation.
60i/30p: Selectable between 1, 3, 6 and 9 frames
24p/60p: Selectable between 2, 6 and 12 frames

Canon DIGIC DV III Image Processor

The XF300 Professional Camcorder features Canon's powerful DIGIC DV III Image Processor, which provides enhanced shading, lifelike tonal gradations, new custom picture settings and lower power consumption. DIGIC DV III is also the high-speed engine which powers Genuine Canon Face Detection. On-the-go videographers will appreciate the ability to track one subject in a crowd of people.

Brilliant Ergonomics

The XF300 Professional Camcorder has set a new standard for ergonomic design in compact pro camcorders. It is designed from the ground up to maximize handheld shooting comfort and usability. Users will find the camera well balanced with the handgrip positioned closer to the optical access near the camera’s center of gravity. This allows the operator to easily maintain a steady shot while minimizing arm fatigue. Controls are ideally placed making the camera feel like a natural extension of the operator’s body.

Additionally, the XF300 features a redesigned layout to make using the camcorder highly intuitive. New users and users switching from other products will find the button layout, camera menu system and camera controls immediately familiar and easy to use out of the box with operational and control organization that conform to industry standards.

Genuine Canon 10x HD Video Lens

Canon's optical expertise is clearly seen in the XF100's Genuine Canon 10x HD Video Lens. It delivers flexibility in image capture with a zoom range of 30.4 – 304mm (35mm equivalent).

Power zoom is available in Constant and Variable settings in 3 modes, Fast (approx. 1.9 – 60 seconds), Normal (approx. 3.0 – 180 seconds) and Slow (approx. 4.0 – 285 seconds). To provide added control, there are 16 predefined steps in Constant mode and rocker switch pressure sensitive or control ring speed management in Variable mode.

For enhanced versatility the XF100 offers a built-in gradation type neutral density (ND) filter (approximately 1/8), as well as an eight blade metal aperture iris.

A customizable manual control ring allows users to assign focus, zoom, or iris. These functions are easily selected through a switch on the lens barrel.

Additionally, a custom dial is available which allows the iris to be controlled.

SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer
The XF100 also incorporates a SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization system (lens shift) with four modes: Standard, Powered, Dynamic and Off
Standard:
Lens shift is controlled so that the maximum compensation angle is constant from wide angle through telephoto.
Powered:
Vibration is suppressed at the telephoto end of the range, where shake is most apparent due to high magnification.
Dynamic:
Stabilization changes throughout the zoom range to minimize more pronounced shaking. This is especially useful at wide-angle focal lengths when walking.

Instant AF
When shooting high definition video, sharp focus becomes more critical than ever. Canon's proprietary Instant AF system combines an external AF sensor with Canon's legendary auto focus system for fast and accurate focus. Together, the two sensors reduce focusing time - even in low-light, low contrast, or high brightness situations - and improve focusing performance on difficult subjects.

The XF100 gives you a choice of five AF modes for different shooting applications: 
Instant AF changes focus as rapidly as possible, for those applications in which quick focus is more important than other considerations - for example, in news gathering or documentary work.
Medium AF changes focus at a speed which is softer and smoother than Instant AF, but faster than would likely be possible manually.
Normal AF changes focus at a speed that appears natural and doesn't distract the viewer.
Face AF tracks focus on faces when present. The user selects the face to be tracked. Face AF has the ability to track even if the subject face is in profile. If the chosen tracked face is not present in a shot, the subject in the center of the screen will automatically be brought into focus.
Face Only AF automatically tracks the chosen tracked face in focus but, should that face leave the scene, will reset focus to manual mode. 

Minimum Object Distance
When shooting with the XF100, the minimum focus distance is 20mm (0.78 inches) at Macro and maintains 60cm (1.97 feet) throughout the entire zoom range. This allows excellent versatility in a wide range of shooting situations.

8-Blade Iris
In contrast to a typical 6-blade iris, the XF100's 8-blade iris captures extraordinarily smooth out-of-focus ‘bokeh' for a more attractive image effect. The additional blades also reduce diffraction of light passing through the iris, allowing for the use of smaller apertures while maintaining image quality.

The Digital Teleconverter extends the reach of the optical zoom, and is selectable by 1.5x, 3x and 6x. This feature is ideal when extreme telephoto shooting is needed such as in sports and wildlife, as well as, surveillance applications for law enforcement and the military. 

Canon Native 1920 x 1080 CMOS Image Sensor

Newly designed and manufactured exclusively by Canon, the XF100 Professional Camcorder incorporates a native 1/3-inch, 1920 x 1080 CMOS Image Sensor, delivering superb Full HD video recording with minimal noise. The high sensitivity and wide dynamic range of this sensor are what demanding users expect from Canon. Slow and fast motion shooting is supported for greater flexibility in creative choice and its compactness contributes greatly to the small, super handy size of the XF100 and its outstanding usability in the field.

Multiple Recording Bit Rates, Resolutions, and Variable Frame Rates

Multiple recording modes, resolutions and frame rates make the XF100 Professional Camcorder creatively flexible and able to work in virtually any production environment.

Slow Motion & Fast Motion
Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the XF100 to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate, resulting in either a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camera is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained.

In 1080 mode, fast motion is supported up to 2.5x the normal rate and as slow as 1/2.5x. In 720 mode, fast motion is supported up to 5x the normal rate and as slow as 1/1.25x.

Interval Recording
With this feature, users can program the camera to record a specified number of frames at specified intervals. The technique can be used to observe natural phenomena over extended periods, making it ideal for time-lapse applications. The interval can be set in 25 levels ranging from 1 second to 10 minutes.

60i/30p: Selectable between 1, 3, 6 and 9 frames
24p/60p: Selectable between 2, 6 and 12 frames

Frame Recording
This setting allows a specified number of frames to be recorded – ideal for projects such as clay animation.

60i/30p: Selectable between 1, 3, 6 and 9 frames
24p/60p: Selectable between 2, 6 and 12 frames

Canon DIGIC DV III Image Processor

The XF100 Professional Camcorder features Canon's powerful DIGIC DV III Image Processor, which provides enhanced shading, lifelike tonal gradations, new custom picture settings and lower power consumption. DIGIC DV III is also the high-speed engine which powers Genuine Canon Face Detection. On-the-go videographers will appreciate the ability to track one subject in a crowd of people.

Built-in 3-D Assist Features 

The XF100 has the ability to be paired with another XF100 or XF105 camcorder to provide true stereoscopic 3-D recording. It offers several features to assist with 3-D production including OIS Lens Shift to aid in optically aligning the two camcorders.

A focal length guide displays the zoom position of each camera in relation to each other and calibrates the zoom distance.

The XF100's compact size provides an alternative to large 3-D rigs allowing 3-D crews to work more quickly and efficiently, while providing the needed features to capture exceptional 3-D imagery.

Infrared Recording

The XF100 Professional Camcorder features an Infrared Mode allowing users to capture video in conditions with little to no ambient light, a situation which would make other camcorders useless. During infrared capture, the infrared cutoff filter is removed from the optical path. Combined with a specially designed lens coating, infrared light is able to pass through to the image sensor. Additionally, the XF100 features an infrared emitter with a diffuser to shoot pleasing infrared imagery even in complete darkness. For the nature videographers or law enforcement users, the benefits of a compact, high performance camcorder for shooting in such conditions is obvious. Without the need to add lights, the shooter may remain hidden from their subjects. Also, the XF100 gives the option of recording in green or white light mode.

Brilliant Ergonomics

The XF100 is designed as an ultra-compact camcorder without compromising on features and usability. Its small size makes this camcorder ideal in situations where every inch and ounce count, such as flying to location or going on expedition. It offers amazing image quality yet can easily be placed in the back of a car or carried in a backpack making the XF100 the perfect camera to go anywhere, anytime on a moment’s notice. 

Large, 3.5-inch, 920,000 Dot LCD Monitor and EVF

3.5-inch, 920,000 Dot LCD Monitor
A 3.5-inch, 920,000 Dot LCD monitor provides an ample, accurate area for critical focus confirmation and approximately 100% field of view. The display opens on the left side of the camera body.

EVF
The XF100 Professional Camcorder features a 0.24-inch, 260,000 Dot Color EVF and approximately 100% field of view coverage for comfortable viewing and accurate judgment of composition. Brightness, contrast, color and backlight are adjustable. The angle of the viewfinder is adjustable up and down through 68º for additional user comfort and when using the LCD display for monitoring.

Focus Assist Functions
Edge Monitor Focus Assist System
With Canon’s new Edge Monitor Focus Assist system, a red and green monitor is shown at the bottom of the LCD Display and three red focus check areas are shown across the display. The green waveform shows overall focus of the image, while the red waveform shows the focus status of the focus check boxes. Through this dynamic focus feedback, the user can intuitively tune focus in a scene and quickly change the zone of focus.

Peaking/Magnify
Two peaking modes and a magnify focus assist function are available in standby and record mode (LCD monitor and EVF), making it extremely easy for the XF100 operator to check and confirm critical focus. 

Exceptional Customization

Users of the XF100 Professional Camcorder have full manual control of all camera functions to adapt to both technical and artistic challenges when shooting. For maximum customization, users have access to Custom Picture Settings, Custom Functions and Custom Display Options to tailor the camera to their creative and production needs. Any combination of these items can be saved to an SD memory card for easy setup and matching of multiple XF100 and XF105 camcorders.

Custom Picture Settings
You can manually set an extensive variety of image quality adjustments and store them as 9 different presets in the camera. Up to 20 may be saved to an SD card. The adjustments include: Gamma, Black Level, Black Gamma, Low Key Saturation, Knee, Sharpness, Noise Reduction, Skin Detail, Selective Noise Reduction, Color Matrix, White Balance, Color Correction and Setup Level.

Custom Functions
The XF100’s operation can be further fine-tuned through the use of Custom Functions. This allows the camcorder to truly match your shooting style. A total of 15 unique items can be adjusted including: Shockless Gain, Shockless White Balance, AE Response, Iris Limit, Iris Ring Direction, Focus Ring Control and Character Record.

As well, for quick access to commonly used functions, the XF100 features 10 customizable control buttons.

Custom Display
The Custom Display function lets you set 32 display items to create a custom LCD/EVF to suit your specific needs. Items that can be selected include: Zoom Position, Audio Level, Remaining Record Time, Exposure, Object Distance, Time Code and more. 

Workflow

Smooth and efficient workflow is an essential part of the production process. Canon’s XF Codec is supported by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Adobe, Apple, Avid and Grass Valley. This ensures the widest compatibility with existing infrastructure and non-linear editing (NLE) software.

Compact Flash Cards
Understanding that accessibility to media is an important part of any file-based workflow, the Canon XF100 Professional Camcorder records to cost-effective Compact Flash (CF) cards, not proprietary media.

MXF Wrapper
The XF100 uses Material Exchange Format (MXF) for its file structure -an internationally standardized container format for the exchange of video and audio material. Using the MXF format, video and audio can be wrapped into a single file along with important metadata. With MXF, the XF100 will not only benefit from the highest level of compatibility with NLE systems, but also with high-end network systems used by many networks and production studios.

Bundled Canon XF Utility Software
Compatible for use on both Mac and Windows platforms, Canon’s XF Utility software provides a simplified first step in the process of managing and playing back your clips.

Additionally, the software can manage lists of clips in a number of display formats, as well as tag, add and edit metadata. It also serves as an efficient means of backing up media. 

Audio System

The utmost in flexibility has been built into the XF100 Professional Camcorder. It has an incorporated stereo microphone, as well as two XLR audio inputs with +48V phantom power and a 3.5mm microphone input terminal. The built-in microphone provides exceptional audio in fast-paced situations while the XLR inputs and microphone input terminal provide connectivity to external microphones. In addition the XLR inputs allow the use of other professional audio devices. If you choose, the built-in microphone and an external microphone can be used simultaneously.

Audio is recorded in 16-bit PCM format at 48 kHz for amazing quality and fidelity. And both the built-in microphone and XLR inputs have the option for automatic or full manual gain control. To prevent variations in the recorded audio level, the dials can be locked by closing the audio panel cover.

Connectivity

Not only does the XF100 Professional Camcorder provide the professional user with complete control over the image, it also provides complete creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs including:

HDMI Output
Component Video Output
Composite Video Output (3.5mm Terminal)
USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Terminal
Remote Control Terminal (compatible with LANC protocol)

Additional Features

Waveform Monitor
Videographers depend on this feature to confirm accurate exposure and color levels during the capture process. Typically only found on expensive external units, the Canon XF100 Professional Camcorder has a waveform monitor built right into the camera. The waveform monitor shows a detailed view of overall image brightness and RGB components.

Optional Canon WD-H58W Wide Converter
Optically matched for the XF100’s HD lens, the WD-H58W Wide Converter provides a magnification factor of 0,8x increasing wide angle capability to approximately 24mm (35mm equivalent).

Intelligent Battery System
The XF100 Professional Camcorder is compatible with Canon’s new BP-925, as well as the BP-955 and BP-975 Intelligent Lithium-ion batteries. These batteries communicate remaining running time (down to the minute) and wear data back to the camcorder, so the user is well-informed at all times. On the outside of the battery, four LED lamps allow battery life to be viewed quickly when in the field.

Additionally, the camcorder is compatible with existing Canon BP-900 series batteries. Batteries can also be inserted and removed while the supplied AC power cable is connected.

Photo Capture
For applications such as storyboarding, continuity and publicity shots, the XF100 offers the ability to capture 1920 x 1080 still images. Photos may be captured to an SD memory card during the time of recording, as well as “frame grabbed” during playback.

Color Bars with Reference Tone
Two types of color bars can be selected:
Type 1 (SMPTE compliant) or Type 2 (ARIB compliant)

1 kHz Reference Tone: -12dB, -18dB, 20dB or OFF

Support for 9 languages including:
German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Russian, English, Chinese (simplified) and Japanese.

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Carl Zeiss has introduced its first Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens to complement the Compact Prime CP.2 line of lenses. According to customer requests it is the first compact zoom lens of its kind with interchangeable mount and full frame capturing capability. The Compact Zoom CZ.2 gives the filmmaker the choice of a single lens in the short-long telephoto range, perfect for separating the fore- and background areas or for situations when the subject is a distance from the camera.<BR><BR>&ldquo;The Compact Zoom CZ.2 70-200/T2.9 is first in a line of zoom lenses designed for the owner-operator from Carl Zeiss that allows them to be used with a wide variety of current and future cameras, because of their compact design, full-frame coverage and interchangeable mounts&rdquo;, notes Christian Bannert, Senior Director R&amp;D, Carl Zeiss Camera Lens Division. &ldquo;There has never been a zoom lens on the market with similar features.&quot;<BR><BR>The Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens is a perfect complement to the smaller, lighter HD video and cine cameras introduced in the last year. Especially when used with Steadicam systems, the weight of the lens and camera becomes a critical factor. Weighing only 2.8kg (6.2lbs), it opens up new creative opportunities for action sequences by allowing the camera to be used hand-held for a greater range of motion. <BR><BR>The Compact Zoom CZ.2 lenses feature a 18-blade aperture, which creates a round iris opening and a natural, out of focus rendition. As with the rest of the Compact Prime CP.2 family, the cine-style housing with gearing allows the attachment of any standard follow-focus system. By using the interchangeable mounts for PL, EF, F, MFT and E, the Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens can be easily adapted to numerous camera systems and ensures compatibility with future cameras as technology changes. The Carl Zeiss T* anti-reflection coating ensures the maximum contrast and color rendition by minimizing stray light and ghosting within the lens. The Compact Zoom CZ.2 delivers flare-free results and it has no focus shift over the whole zoom range.<BR><BR>More compact zoom lenses also made in Germany with additional focal lengths will be announced during the course of this year. <BR><BR></SPAN>]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[22.3 Megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor 
The EOS 5D Mark III features a newly developed Canon full-frame 22.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor that's designed from the ground up to create high resolution, perfectly detailed images with unprecedented speed and clarity. A full 24 x 36mm, the sensor captures 5784 x 3861 large individual 6.25 μm pixels and has a much-improved S/N ratio. A new photodiode structure with an increased photoelectric conversion rate increases the sensor's sensitivity by approximately 2 stops over previous models, meaning higher ISOs with the lowest noise of any EOS digital camera. And a 2-line 8-channel simultaneous signal readout means speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG) are possible!

14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) 
The EOS 5D Mark III not only offers 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, it delivers higher standard and expanded ISOs, and a score of new options to enhance shooting in varied and fast-changing lighting situations. With a standard range of ISO 100-25600, the EOS 5D Mark III represents a 2-stop increase in sensitivity over previous cameras. Thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the new sensor and powerful noise reduction, the EOS 5D Mark III can shoot at expanded sensitivities down to ISO 50 (L) and up to 51200 (H1), and even 102400 (H2)! 

DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and blazing processing speed 
The EOS 5D Mark III uses a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG), and the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data processing performance and features new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration in both still and motion images. 

All new 61-Point High Density Reticular AF 
The newly designed 61-Point High Density Reticular AF features an Offset Array Sensor (with staggering AF point arrangement) to deliver greater accuracy, no matter the situation. It offers multi-zone wide-area AF for better tracking, has 5 central dual cross-type points (f/2.8 diagonal), 21 central cross-type points (f/5.6 horizontal & vertical) and 20 outer cross-type points (f/4.0 horizontal), and is sensitive in extremely low-light situations (EV-2 for a central point with a f/2.8 lens).

iFCL Metering with 63-zone dual-layering metering sensor 
The EOS 5D Mark III features Canon's multi-layer 63-zone iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminance) Metering System that integrates the cameras AF system into its readings. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding the chosen AF point(s), this new system delivers an entirely new level of accuracy, especially in situations where the light changes quickly. The metering sensor enables evaluative, center weighted, partial and spot metering, plus offers 5-step exposure compensation for perfectly exposed images, every time.

EOS HD Video with manual exposure control, multiple frame rates and selectable All i-frame or IPB compression. 
The EOS 5D Mark III offers both All-I and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding during recording only (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run), useful for multi-camera shoots. It also features improved sound recording adjustment capabilities, offering 64-step volume control accessible through the Quick Control screen during video shooting, plus a dedicated headphone jack for convenience in shooting. ]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[A superb refinement to a true Canon classic, the new TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II offers enhanced functionality and image quality in its most popular tilt-shift focal length. Designed with UD glass to minimize and compensate for chromatic aberrations and a specially coated aspherical element for the highest possible glare-free image quality, this tilt-shift lens features an angle of view of 84° on a full-frame camera.

New TS rotation lets users freely combine tilting and shifting within the range of +/- 90° in the direction of movement. The Tilt function has an enhanced range of movement of up to +/- 8.5°, a revolving construction for both portrait and landscape shooting modes, locking, ergonomically-designed and easily operated tilt and shift knobs, uses a circular aperture for beautiful out-of-focus areas, and is constructed using only lead-free glass and has an SWC lens coating that controls ghosting and flare to a far greater degree than earlier coating technologies.

Litepanels has added the ability to operate the updated Sola ENG LED Light on both battery power and now A/C power (with the included A/C adapter). As well as other features, the new kit further includes a detachable 2 Pin D-Tap power cable, and stand adapter.<BR><BR>The new version will be configured and shipped as follows:<BR><BR>Sola ENG LED Fresnel Light<BR>Two-Leaf Barn Door<BR>3-Piece Gel Filter Set (1/4 Correction, Full Correction, Diffusion)<BR>New: A/C Power Supply with Power Cord<BR>New: Stand Adapter (TVMP)<BR>New: Detachable 2-Pin D-Tap DC Power Cable<BR>Deluxe Ball Head Shoe Mount<BR>Conversion Kit<BR>1/4-20 Adapter<BR>Carrying Case<BR><BR><BR></SPAN>]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Highly Controllable
Like all Litepanels, Sola Fresnels feature instant dimming from 100% to 0 with no noticeable color shift. Plus the Sola ENG offers beam control of 50º to 15º. Designed for on-camera or stand mounting, the Sola ENG provides manual focus and dimming control via camera-like erganomic controls. Output is fully flicker free, and remains consistent even as the battery voltage goes down.

Power Efficient and Lightweight
Employing Litepanels' utra-efficient LEDs, Litepanels Sola draw just about 1/10 the amount of power to provide the same illumination of a conventional tungsten Fresnel, with very little heat generation. The cool-the-the-touch feature of LED lights not only cuts down on air conditioning requirements, but since they don’t require heat dissipation and protection necessary for conventional Fresnels, the Solas weigh only 1/3 as much as their HMI and tungsten predecessors (and have no external ballasts).

ADVANTAGES FOR VIDEO & STILL
Proprietary Heat-Free LED technology
Produces bright, HD friendly light
Integrated dimmer 100% to 0 with no noticeable color shift
Flicker-Free light output
Eco-Friendly - Uses up to 95% less energy

		<description><![CDATA[The Sony NEX-FS700U Super 35 Camcorder with 18-200mm Lens is a fully professional large-sensor video camera. Hot on the heels of the FS100, this compact, highly modular camera uses a very similar-sized Super 35 CMOS sensor as the FS100. But as a marked improvement over that earlier model's sensor, the FS700 features a native 4K resolution sensor.

Unlike smaller, broadcast-style sensors or the larger "full-frame" sensors of some DSLRs, the NEX-FS700's imaging area matches that of standard Hollywood film cameras, providing complete compatibility with cine-style film lenses (sold separately), as well as the Sony 18 - 200mm lens (that's 27 - 300mm in terms of 35mm equivalence). The sensor's large size offers a variety of other advantages, including increased control over depth of field, higher sensitivity in low light, lower image noise, and an exceptional dynamic range.

Able to shoot full 1080p video in a range of frame rates up to 60p, the FS700 provides the option of recording AVCHD footage onto SD card/MemoryStick or via the FMU (flash memory unit) port, or it can output 4:2:2 video (with embedded timecode) via HDMI 1.4 or 3G/HD-SDI to an external recording unit. Simultaneous recording to both is also possible when instant backup is called for. There's no stinting on audio, either, as the camera includes not only a shotgun microphone with mount/carrying handle, but dual XLR inputs for recording uncompressed, professional-level sound from an external source.

One unique feature for a camcorder of this class is the FS700's ability to record bursts of super-slow motion video at rates up to 960 fps. (These bursts range from 8 to 16 seconds, depending of the frame rate). Full-resolution recording is possible at up to 240 fps; at 480 and 960 fps, resolution is reduced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >UWP Series UHF synthesized wireless microphone system. Package includes a lavalier microphone, bodypack transmitter and portable diversity tuner. Mounting adapter for camcorder included. Channels 30 to 33. The UWP-V1 includes extremely robust metal construction, mic/line input selection on the bodypack transmitter, a miniature metal body omni-directional microphone and plus the receiver includes a convenient auto channel scanning function allowing automatic search for unoccupied channels. UWP Series transmitters and receivers can also be purchased separately (see optional accessories for details).</SPAN>]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[PLL Synthesized System
Achieves stable transmission and reception by using a UHF PLL (Phase Locked Loop) frequency synthesized system, which provides accurate carrier signal frequencies. This system is used in both the transmitters and tuners, so that a stable carrier is generated at the transmitter, and accurately tuned in at the tuner. This PLL-controlled system provides highly stable, user-selectable frequencies in increments of 125 kHz.

Space Diversity Reception System
Typically, wireless microphone transmission systems can be subject to reception interruptions (signal dropout), but UWP series tuners reduce this to a minimum. By utilizing a space-diversity reception system, it achieves stable reception by using dual-antenna inputs/reception circuits. These receive signals over two different paths and automatically select the stronger RF signal for output.

Tone Squelch Circuitry
To avoid picking up carrier signals transmitted from other systems, the transmitter transmits a 32 kHz pilot-tone signal along with the audio signal. The tuner's squelch circuit recognizes this tone signal, and outputs the audio signal only when this tone signal is received. This function prevents the output of unwanted signals and noise from other signal transmissions in the air, as well as the RF noise and popping noise that occur when the transmitter is powered on or off.

Simultaneous Multi-Channel Operation
Simultaneous operation of up to 16 wireless microphones. Optimum combinations of practically tested, interference-free frequencies are stored in the tuner. By using the pre-programmed frequency groups, users can easily choose interference-free frequencies for the transmitters and tuners, simplifying the task of system setup.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >The ECM-88B is a miniature omni-directional electret-condenser microphone ideally suited for quality-critical applications in broadcasting, theater and field production. This lavalier mic achieves high-sensitivity and has a flat-and-wide frequency response. The ECM-88B offers extremely low handling noise with unparalleled high sound quality. The ECM-88B comes with a DC-78 power supply and it has a cable length of 8.2 feet. This model is best suited for wired lav mic applications. However; with the DC-78 power supply disconnected, the ECM-88B's 4-pin (SMC9-4P) connector can also be used with Sony WRT-822B and WRT-8B wireless mic body-pack transmitters.</SPAN>]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Low handling noise	Moving around while wearing a lavalier mic can often cause lav mic cables to rub against a users clothing. In many existing lavalier mic designs, this (frequently unavoidable) body movement can cause loud undesirable handling noise. The ECM-88B radically reduces this handling noise making it ideal for use in applications where users are moving.
Flat-and-wide frequency response	Many lavalier microphones are specifically optimized for speech reproduction and have limited use in other applications. The ECM-88B extends it's frequency response beyond the range of speech reproduction, and can be used for many high quality sound applications requiring a miniature mic that can easily be concealed.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[Full-Frame Capture With DIGIC 5+ Power.

Newly designed 20.2 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS sensor 
The EOS 6D features a newly developed Canon Full-Frame 20.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor for high resolution, perfectly detailed images delivered with incredible speed and performance. A 35.8mm x 23.9mm sensor captures images of 5472 x 3648 pixels with a pixel size of 6.55 µm square for fantastic detail and a superior signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in great images from the start. With no conversion factor, the EOS 6D’s sensor ensures that lenses mounted on the camera will deliver the same angle of view they would on a traditional 35mm camera. Working in tandem with the EOS 6D’s DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, the sensor containing a new photodiode structure delivers ISO sensitivities of 100-25600 (with expanded sensitivities of L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) and can shoot at up to 4.5 frames per second. Wrapped up in the EOS 6D’s compact and lightweight body, photography with a full-frame sensor has never been so easy and so portable.

14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) 
The EOS 6D offers 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, delivers high standard and expanded ISOs, and a score of new options to enhance shooting in varied and fast-changing lighting situations. The EOS 6D has a standard range of ISO 100-25600 but thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the newly designed sensor and powerful noise reduction, the camera can shoot at expanded sensitivities down to ISO 50 (L) and up to ISO 51200 (H1), and even expand to ISO 102400 (H2)! Beyond the obvious advantages of its wide ISO range, the EOS 6D has automatic ISO settings, which can be found on the dedicated ISO menu. Minimum and maximum ISO settings can be specified, as can a user-defined range, plus full auto and manual.

DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and exceptional processing speed 
For a whole new level of performance, the EOS 6D uses a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 4.5 fps (RAW + JPEG), the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data processing performance and features new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions, the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration in both still and motion images. With the power of this processor, speed improvements are noticeable from the instant the camera is turned on and the stunning results speak for themselves.

Brilliant AF, No Matter the Light.

High Performance Composing and Focus 
The EOS 6D has an entirely new 11-point AF system for fast, accurate AF no matter the situation. With its new centered cross-type AF point with EV -3 sensitivity for improved performance and focus in low light, and a newly developed and bright 21mm eye point viewfinder with 97% coverage, the EOS 6D offers impressive performance in both composition and AF, even in the dimmest lighting situations. Offering not only One-Shot AF, AI Servo AF, and AI Focus AF, the EOS 6D’s AI Servo focus can be customized with tracking, acceleration and deceleration tracking sensitivities, and 1st or 2nd image priority adjustments. For even more customization, adjustment levels for the wide-angle and telephoto ends of particular lenses can be entered and recorded into the camera’s memory.

Superlative, Intelligent Metering.

iFCL Metering with 63-zone dual-layering metering sensor 
The EOS 6D features Canon’s multi-layer 63-zone iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminance) Metering System that integrates the camera’s AF system into its readings. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding the chosen AF point(s), this system delivers accurate results, especially in situations where the light changes quickly. The metering sensor enables evaluative, center weighted, partial and spot metering, plus offers 5-step exposure compensation for perfectly exposed images, every time.

Fast Capture for Fast Action.

High speed continuous shooting up to 4.5 fps allows you to capture fast action. 
With continuous shooting speed up to 4.5 frames per second, the EOS 6D keeps up with the action. It is designed to capture the shots photographers want when shooting rapidly unfolding scenes.

Cutting Edge HD Movie Capture.

EOS HD Video with manual exposure control and multiple frame rates 
The EOS 6D captures HD video with a level of sophistication on par with professional movie cameras, offering phenomenal performance on a DSLR. It offers both All-I (UHS-I memory card is required) and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding during recording only (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run), useful for multi-camera shoots. It also features improved sound recording adjustment capabilities, offering 64-step volume control accessible through the Quick Control screen, as well as a 3.5mm microphone terminal. The CMOS sensor’s drive system significantly increases image processor performance, reducing color artifacts and moiré (a common problem that occurs in scenes with horizontal lines), and ensures that the EOS 6D can record at a number of frame rates up to ISO 25600 in H mode.

All-I
Compresses each frame. Although the file size is larger than IPB, each frame is not affected by the previous and next frames, making it suitable for editing and extracting frames.
IPB
Compresses the movie frame by referencing the previous and next frames. High compression is used, making it suitable for recording long movies.

Sophisticated Wireless System.

The simplicity and convenience of Wi-Fi, built-in. 
The new EOS 6D features built-in Wi-Fi, incorporating cutting edge technology into the camera’s compact and lightweight design. The EOS 6D’s exposure settings such as aperture, shutter speed and ISO, focus, and shutter can be operated wirelessly using an iOS or Android smartphone with the free Canon EOS Remote app (available soon). Using a smartphone with the EOS Remote app installed, shoot remotely from a distance, even in Live View mode, for those difficult-to-capture shots; you can also review images in the EOS 6D without having to take it out of the bag, and easily transfer and save images directly from the camera to a smartphone. Full DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) compatibility means easy sharing between the EOS 6D and other DLNA products, like HDTVs, smartphones and more. Still images can even be transferred between two Wi-Fi enabled Canon cameras over a Local Area Network. Images and video can be uploaded instantly to CANON iMAGE GATEWAY for easy sharing on social networking sites, and photos can even be printed on a Wi-Fi compatible printer without the need for a PC. Remarkably, the EOS 6D gains all of these wireless features without the need for any additional accessories; they’re built right in!

Extraordinary GPS, Built-in.

Simple GPS, built right in. 
Ideal for travel or nature photography, the EOS 6D’s built-in GPS can record longitude, latitude and altitude data as EXIF data, can track movement at set intervals with its logging function and can even set the camera's internal clock to local time! When using the logger function on a computer, you will see the exact route you travelled, and the map will show you where and when you took each image.

Ergonomic & Ready to Go.

Compact and lightweight body with shutter durability tested up to 100,000 cycles 
For photographers on the move, there’s nothing quite like the full-frame performance available with the EOS 6D. It’s designed to be portable, light and simple to operate yet doesn’t compromise the quality one expects from EOS SLRs. With an aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis and a magnesium polycarbonate resin exterior, plus a shutter rated to 100,000 cycles, the EOS 6D offers the perfect combination of lightweight and durable materials for reliable operation day after day.

EOS Integrated Cleaning System for improved vibration-based dust removal 
The Integrated Cleaning System featured in the EOS 6D delivers great dust removal for clearer images. To prevent dust accumulation, the system removes particles on the surface of the glass filter by vibrating the glass ultrasonically. The particles are then absorbed by an adsorbent at the bottom of the unit; the unit itself is completely sealed for protection against external contaminants, and the front face of the low-pass glass filter is treated with an anti-dust fluorine coating, making it easier to remove damp or sticky dust particles.

Easy, Low-reflection Viewing.

3.0-inch TFT LCD Monitor 
The EOS 6D’s 3.0" TFT LCD monitor has 1,040,000 dots, anti-reflective construction and features Canon’s Clear View technology for a bright, sharp display in any number of shooting situations. It’s ideal for reviewing settings and images, as well as for shooting in Live View mode. In Live View, grid lines can be displayed in 9 sections, 24 sections, or 9 sections with diagonals, as can the electronic level, which helps ensure accurate level by displaying roll. For image review, the EOS 6D has a dedicated Magnify/Reduce button. While pressing the button, zooming in or out (up to 10x) is achieved simply by turning the Main Dial. Images can be protected or erased quickly, individually or in batches, and slideshows can be created with some or all images and can be sequenced by date, folders, movies, stills or rating. A feature guide can be accessed for the selected menu, providing detailed reference information whenever needed.

Amazing Results with Numerous Shooting Modes.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) 
With its High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, the EOS 6D can merge 3 images of varying exposure in camera and save them as one final image, capturing a broad range of shadow and highlight detail with stunning tonal range. Adjustable to cover a range of ±3 stops, HDR recording truly expands the parameters of the light and dark detail a camera can actually record, surprising viewers with the range of tones a photograph can accurately recreate.

Multiple Exposure Control 
The EOS 6D offers a Multiple Exposure mode for film-like image creation with the convenience of in-camera processing. It offers two different compositing methods for proper exposure and composition: additive or average. Multiple exposure shots from 2 to 9 are stored as one final image and can be taken in both RAW and JPEG shooting modes. A RAW image previously captured by the EOS 6D (3:2 aspect ratio only) can be used as a starting point, and cumulative results can be observed and corrected in real time on the camera's LCD screen.

Scene Intelligent Auto mode 
An enhanced Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.

Special Scene modes 
The EOS 6D features a variety of Special Scene modes that achieve high-quality images: Handheld Night Scene and HDR Backlight Control. The Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas by shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, making dramatic nighttime photography simple. The HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark by shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images; the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.

Easy and Versatile Recording Options.

Compatible with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including new Ultra High Speed cards. 
The EOS 6D uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC memory cards, and is even compatible with the newest Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the portable EOS 6D’s lightweight design.

More Features, More Capabilities.

Peripheral Illumination Correction, Chromatic Aberration Correction, and Distortion Correction 
The EOS 6D features a number of corrective tools to accommodate for the particulars of the lens used. Canon’s lens peripheral illumination correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image. Chromatic aberration can be corrected at the time of shooting with the EOS 6D’s Chromatic Aberration Correction tool. The Distortion Correction feature corrects distortions such as curved lines by correcting for the characteristics of the particular lens used to take the shot, so images that may have been distorted in the captured image appear straight. The camera has correction data for a number of EF lenses preloaded, and new lenses can be added to the camera’s database via EOS Utility. The camera can even distinguish between different lenses of the same model using the serial number (with compatible EF lenses).

Auto Picture Style & Scene Intelligent Auto (A+) 
The EOS 6D not only features a number of Canon’s Picture Style settings but also a Picture Style Auto setting that finely controls color tones for every composition based on information from the camera’s EOS Scene Detection System. This can be an effective feature not only in normal scenes, where “standard” punchy contrast will be used, but also in nature and outdoor scenes, where the blues and greens will look more vivid without the need to switch the camera’s Picture Style to Landscape.

In-Camera RAW Processing & JPEG Resize 
The EOS 6D features state of the art in-camera RAW processing for quick conversion of RAW files to JPEG with control over size, brightness, WB, Picture Style, Auto Lighting Optimizer, Noise reduction, color space, distortion correction and more. Additionally, the EOS 6D features expanded Quick Control functions during playback like image protect, image rotate, rating, RAW image processing, resize, highlight alert, AF point and image jump, meaning a streamlined workflow can begin in the field.

Comparative Playback 
The EOS 6D’s comparative playback mode enables images to be played back two at a time, side by side. A tremendous, in-camera timesaver, comparative playback means images can quickly be enlarged simultaneously to compare focus, blur and noise, and can be individually rated, deleted or locked.

Silent Shooting 
The EOS 6D offers a silent, low vibration shooting mode. By slowing down and muting the shutter and mirror reflex action, the camera is capable of handheld, virtually imperceptible operation for discrete shooting in more situations.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[Full-Frame Capture With DIGIC 5+ Power.

Newly designed 20.2 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS sensor 
The EOS 6D features a newly developed Canon Full-Frame 20.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor for high resolution, perfectly detailed images delivered with incredible speed and performance. A 35.8mm x 23.9mm sensor captures images of 5472 x 3648 pixels with a pixel size of 6.55 µm square for fantastic detail and a superior signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in great images from the start. With no conversion factor, the EOS 6D’s sensor ensures that lenses mounted on the camera will deliver the same angle of view they would on a traditional 35mm camera. Working in tandem with the EOS 6D’s DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, the sensor containing a new photodiode structure delivers ISO sensitivities of 100-25600 (with expanded sensitivities of L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) and can shoot at up to 4.5 frames per second. Wrapped up in the EOS 6D’s compact and lightweight body, photography with a full-frame sensor has never been so easy and so portable.

14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) 
The EOS 6D offers 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, delivers high standard and expanded ISOs, and a score of new options to enhance shooting in varied and fast-changing lighting situations. The EOS 6D has a standard range of ISO 100-25600 but thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the newly designed sensor and powerful noise reduction, the camera can shoot at expanded sensitivities down to ISO 50 (L) and up to ISO 51200 (H1), and even expand to ISO 102400 (H2)! Beyond the obvious advantages of its wide ISO range, the EOS 6D has automatic ISO settings, which can be found on the dedicated ISO menu. Minimum and maximum ISO settings can be specified, as can a user-defined range, plus full auto and manual.

DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and exceptional processing speed 
For a whole new level of performance, the EOS 6D uses a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 4.5 fps (RAW + JPEG), the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data processing performance and features new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions, the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration in both still and motion images. With the power of this processor, speed improvements are noticeable from the instant the camera is turned on and the stunning results speak for themselves.

Brilliant AF, No Matter the Light.

High Performance Composing and Focus 
The EOS 6D has an entirely new 11-point AF system for fast, accurate AF no matter the situation. With its new centered cross-type AF point with EV -3 sensitivity for improved performance and focus in low light, and a newly developed and bright 21mm eye point viewfinder with 97% coverage, the EOS 6D offers impressive performance in both composition and AF, even in the dimmest lighting situations. Offering not only One-Shot AF, AI Servo AF, and AI Focus AF, the EOS 6D’s AI Servo focus can be customized with tracking, acceleration and deceleration tracking sensitivities, and 1st or 2nd image priority adjustments. For even more customization, adjustment levels for the wide-angle and telephoto ends of particular lenses can be entered and recorded into the camera’s memory.

Superlative, Intelligent Metering.

iFCL Metering with 63-zone dual-layering metering sensor 
The EOS 6D features Canon’s multi-layer 63-zone iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminance) Metering System that integrates the camera’s AF system into its readings. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding the chosen AF point(s), this system delivers accurate results, especially in situations where the light changes quickly. The metering sensor enables evaluative, center weighted, partial and spot metering, plus offers 5-step exposure compensation for perfectly exposed images, every time.

Fast Capture for Fast Action.

High speed continuous shooting up to 4.5 fps allows you to capture fast action. 
With continuous shooting speed up to 4.5 frames per second, the EOS 6D keeps up with the action. It is designed to capture the shots photographers want when shooting rapidly unfolding scenes.

Cutting Edge HD Movie Capture.

EOS HD Video with manual exposure control and multiple frame rates 
The EOS 6D captures HD video with a level of sophistication on par with professional movie cameras, offering phenomenal performance on a DSLR. It offers both All-I (UHS-I memory card is required) and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding during recording only (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run), useful for multi-camera shoots. It also features improved sound recording adjustment capabilities, offering 64-step volume control accessible through the Quick Control screen, as well as a 3.5mm microphone terminal. The CMOS sensor’s drive system significantly increases image processor performance, reducing color artifacts and moiré (a common problem that occurs in scenes with horizontal lines), and ensures that the EOS 6D can record at a number of frame rates up to ISO 25600 in H mode.

All-I
Compresses each frame. Although the file size is larger than IPB, each frame is not affected by the previous and next frames, making it suitable for editing and extracting frames.
IPB
Compresses the movie frame by referencing the previous and next frames. High compression is used, making it suitable for recording long movies.

Sophisticated Wireless System.

The simplicity and convenience of Wi-Fi, built-in. 
The new EOS 6D features built-in Wi-Fi, incorporating cutting edge technology into the camera’s compact and lightweight design. The EOS 6D’s exposure settings such as aperture, shutter speed and ISO, focus, and shutter can be operated wirelessly using an iOS or Android smartphone with the free Canon EOS Remote app (available soon). Using a smartphone with the EOS Remote app installed, shoot remotely from a distance, even in Live View mode, for those difficult-to-capture shots; you can also review images in the EOS 6D without having to take it out of the bag, and easily transfer and save images directly from the camera to a smartphone. Full DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) compatibility means easy sharing between the EOS 6D and other DLNA products, like HDTVs, smartphones and more. Still images can even be transferred between two Wi-Fi enabled Canon cameras over a Local Area Network. Images and video can be uploaded instantly to CANON iMAGE GATEWAY for easy sharing on social networking sites, and photos can even be printed on a Wi-Fi compatible printer without the need for a PC. Remarkably, the EOS 6D gains all of these wireless features without the need for any additional accessories; they’re built right in!

Extraordinary GPS, Built-in.

Simple GPS, built right in. 
Ideal for travel or nature photography, the EOS 6D’s built-in GPS can record longitude, latitude and altitude data as EXIF data, can track movement at set intervals with its logging function and can even set the camera's internal clock to local time! When using the logger function on a computer, you will see the exact route you travelled, and the map will show you where and when you took each image.

Ergonomic & Ready to Go.

Compact and lightweight body with shutter durability tested up to 100,000 cycles 
For photographers on the move, there’s nothing quite like the full-frame performance available with the EOS 6D. It’s designed to be portable, light and simple to operate yet doesn’t compromise the quality one expects from EOS SLRs. With an aluminum alloy and polycarbonate chassis and a magnesium polycarbonate resin exterior, plus a shutter rated to 100,000 cycles, the EOS 6D offers the perfect combination of lightweight and durable materials for reliable operation day after day.

EOS Integrated Cleaning System for improved vibration-based dust removal 
The Integrated Cleaning System featured in the EOS 6D delivers great dust removal for clearer images. To prevent dust accumulation, the system removes particles on the surface of the glass filter by vibrating the glass ultrasonically. The particles are then absorbed by an adsorbent at the bottom of the unit; the unit itself is completely sealed for protection against external contaminants, and the front face of the low-pass glass filter is treated with an anti-dust fluorine coating, making it easier to remove damp or sticky dust particles.

Easy, Low-reflection Viewing.

3.0-inch TFT LCD Monitor 
The EOS 6D’s 3.0" TFT LCD monitor has 1,040,000 dots, anti-reflective construction and features Canon’s Clear View technology for a bright, sharp display in any number of shooting situations. It’s ideal for reviewing settings and images, as well as for shooting in Live View mode. In Live View, grid lines can be displayed in 9 sections, 24 sections, or 9 sections with diagonals, as can the electronic level, which helps ensure accurate level by displaying roll. For image review, the EOS 6D has a dedicated Magnify/Reduce button. While pressing the button, zooming in or out (up to 10x) is achieved simply by turning the Main Dial. Images can be protected or erased quickly, individually or in batches, and slideshows can be created with some or all images and can be sequenced by date, folders, movies, stills or rating. A feature guide can be accessed for the selected menu, providing detailed reference information whenever needed.

Amazing Results with Numerous Shooting Modes.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) 
With its High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, the EOS 6D can merge 3 images of varying exposure in camera and save them as one final image, capturing a broad range of shadow and highlight detail with stunning tonal range. Adjustable to cover a range of ±3 stops, HDR recording truly expands the parameters of the light and dark detail a camera can actually record, surprising viewers with the range of tones a photograph can accurately recreate.

Multiple Exposure Control 
The EOS 6D offers a Multiple Exposure mode for film-like image creation with the convenience of in-camera processing. It offers two different compositing methods for proper exposure and composition: additive or average. Multiple exposure shots from 2 to 9 are stored as one final image and can be taken in both RAW and JPEG shooting modes. A RAW image previously captured by the EOS 6D (3:2 aspect ratio only) can be used as a starting point, and cumulative results can be observed and corrected in real time on the camera's LCD screen.

Scene Intelligent Auto mode 
An enhanced Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.

Special Scene modes 
The EOS 6D features a variety of Special Scene modes that achieve high-quality images: Handheld Night Scene and HDR Backlight Control. The Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas by shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, making dramatic nighttime photography simple. The HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark by shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images; the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.

Easy and Versatile Recording Options.

Compatible with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including new Ultra High Speed cards. 
The EOS 6D uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC memory cards, and is even compatible with the newest Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the portable EOS 6D’s lightweight design.

More Features, More Capabilities.

Peripheral Illumination Correction, Chromatic Aberration Correction, and Distortion Correction 
The EOS 6D features a number of corrective tools to accommodate for the particulars of the lens used. Canon’s lens peripheral illumination correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image. Chromatic aberration can be corrected at the time of shooting with the EOS 6D’s Chromatic Aberration Correction tool. The Distortion Correction feature corrects distortions such as curved lines by correcting for the characteristics of the particular lens used to take the shot, so images that may have been distorted in the captured image appear straight. The camera has correction data for a number of EF lenses preloaded, and new lenses can be added to the camera’s database via EOS Utility. The camera can even distinguish between different lenses of the same model using the serial number (with compatible EF lenses).

Auto Picture Style & Scene Intelligent Auto (A+) 
The EOS 6D not only features a number of Canon’s Picture Style settings but also a Picture Style Auto setting that finely controls color tones for every composition based on information from the camera’s EOS Scene Detection System. This can be an effective feature not only in normal scenes, where “standard” punchy contrast will be used, but also in nature and outdoor scenes, where the blues and greens will look more vivid without the need to switch the camera’s Picture Style to Landscape.

In-Camera RAW Processing & JPEG Resize 
The EOS 6D features state of the art in-camera RAW processing for quick conversion of RAW files to JPEG with control over size, brightness, WB, Picture Style, Auto Lighting Optimizer, Noise reduction, color space, distortion correction and more. Additionally, the EOS 6D features expanded Quick Control functions during playback like image protect, image rotate, rating, RAW image processing, resize, highlight alert, AF point and image jump, meaning a streamlined workflow can begin in the field.

Comparative Playback 
The EOS 6D’s comparative playback mode enables images to be played back two at a time, side by side. A tremendous, in-camera timesaver, comparative playback means images can quickly be enlarged simultaneously to compare focus, blur and noise, and can be individually rated, deleted or locked.

Silent Shooting 
The EOS 6D offers a silent, low vibration shooting mode. By slowing down and muting the shutter and mirror reflex action, the camera is capable of handheld, virtually imperceptible operation for discrete shooting in more situations.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Record. Monitor. Transfer.<BR><BR>Simplifying Production<BR>The portable PIX 240i is an essential companion for any production environment. It simplifies any production and post-production environment bringing edit-ready Apple ProRes or Avid DNxHD recording to SD/HD-SDI or HDMI-equipped video cameras.<BR><BR>File-Based Recording<BR>The PIX 240i records Quicktime files in either Apple ProRes or Avid DNxHD video formats. Files recorded in these intra-frame codecs are ready-for-editing directly from the recorder. For color-critical applications recording to Apple ProRes 4444 provides uncompressed alpha-channel transparency for superb chroma keying and grading performance.<BR><BR>Extensive Video I/O<BR>The video input on the PIX 240i has extensive compatibility with a wide range of cameras. It's BNC input accepts 12-bit 3G SDI (4:4:4 RGB or YCbCr), HD-SDI, SDI. Its HDMI input accepts high-definition and standard-definition video.<BR><BR>With its 3G-SDI 4:4:4 input, recording to ProRes 4444 offers recordings that are perceptually indistinguishable from the original source material.<BR><BR>Frame Rate Converter and Scaler<BR>The PIX 240i features a powerful hardware scaler and frame rate converter. Up, down, cross-conversion and pulldown removal give users the ability to record files in a customer-requested rate, even rates not supported by the camera. The PIX 240i also supports aspect ratio conversion, HD to SD and SD to HD.<BR><BR>Time Code Generator<BR>The on-board high-accuracy Ambient time code generator makes the PIX 240i right at home on any production from simple single camera shoots, to complex multi-camera sync-sound productions. All common time code frame rates and modes are supported. Embedded time code over SDI and HDMI is also supported.<BR><BR>IPS Field Monitor<BR>With its 5-inch, IPS display, the PIX 240i becomes an accurate field monitor for production cameras. The display&rsquo;s accurate color representation and excellent off-axis visibility assist in framing, exposure evaluation, and focus evaluation. It is complete with 12-step false color and two-level zebra, peaking, and 1:1 pixel viewing.<BR><BR>Defeatable detail overlayed on the picture includes audio metering, time code, file type, record status, and frame rate information. The display also doubles as a fast, simple menu interface.<BR><BR>Time code and record state display can be sent to the SDI and HDMI outputs.<BR><BR>Superb Audio Performance<BR>With its deep expertise in production sound, Sound Devices included no-compromise audio performance into the PIX 240i. Its full-sized XLR audio inputs accept microphone or line level signals. Microphone-level inputs offer 48 V phantom power, input limiters, and sweepable high-pass filters. Inputs can also be set to accept AES3 digital audio, up to four channels.<BR><BR>Inputs offer selectable audio delay. Since video cameras often introduce several frames of delay because of internal processing, audio signals connected directly to the PIX 240i can be delayed up to 500 ms to accommodate that delay and provide perfect synchronization between video and audio signals.<BR><BR>Playback<BR>The PIX 240i offers a wide range of playback features. Off-speed, forward, backward, freeze-frame, looping, and custom playlists give users extensive playback control. File markers can be set while in record or playback mode with the press of a button and loop playback modes allow continuous looping playback of entire files or between files markers. Playlists allow users to quickly organize multiple files for consecutive or loop playback.<BR><BR>File Storage and Transfer<BR>PIX 220i and PIX 240i record and play back Quicktime files to either removable CompactFlash cards or removable 2.5-inch solid-state drives (recording media and PIX-CADDY 2 are optional accessories). Both CompactFlash and SSD media are formatted by PIX recorders as UDF volumes that are directly mountable, readable, and writable in Mac OS and Windows.<BR><BR>Mechanical Construction<BR>The PIX 240i is designed and built for the rigors of field production with a durable chassis made of light weight, molded, metalized-carbon-fiber. Its four 1/4-20 thread mounts on two different axis offer countless mounting options. All important connections on the PIX 240i use full-sized, locking connectors, including its BNC video and XLR audio connections. Data drives mount to the available PIX-CADDY2 for a secure, hot-swappable, locking data connection.<BR><BR>Powering<BR>The PIX 240i is powered from removable Sony-compatible (L-mount) lithium-ion camcorder batteries or external 10-18 VDC power. Battery mounts are connected in parallel so batteries can be hot-swapped during operation, with no loss of power. When external power is removed while a removable battery is mounted, the PIX 240i seamlessly transfers to battery power. Battery source and voltage is shown on the on-screen display.<BR><BR>Controls<BR>The side panel rotary knob makes menu navigation fast and simple. Simple controls and a straight-forward plain-language menu makes setups easy for both new and experienced users. Four large, illuminated, tactile record, stop, play, rew, and fast-forward controls are easy to access with gloved hands. Screen and button brightness are adjustable.<BR></SPAN>]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[4K Ready 
The CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to provide outstanding optical performance and is capable of full 4K-Resolution performance. Whether you're shooting in HD with a Canon EOS DSLR camera or in 4K using an EOS C500 Digital Cinema Camera, the CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F will help you to create a cinematic masterpiece by providing superb image quality, contrast and color fidelity.
EF Mount 
The CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lenses features a genuine Canon EF mount and works with all Cinema EOS camera models, as well as, all EOS HD-DSLR cameras including Full-Frame models. The EF mount has electronic contacts on both the lens and camera sides that allow direct communication between each device. This communication allows lens metadata including T-numbers to be displayed in the viewfinder. Both the T-number and the focus position are recorded in the video file.
11-Blade Iris 
The use of an 11-blade iris produces artistic and beautiful out-of-focus areas or "Bokeh." The 11 blades allow for attractive circular blurring in out-of-focus regions, while the use of an odd number of blades helps reduce flaring of specular highlights. Additionally, the iris ring is mechanically controlled with no click stops for smooth exposure adjustments while recording.
Designed for Cinema Style Lens Control 
Designed to meet the needs of professional cinematographers, the CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens features unified front lens diameters and gear positioning on the focus and iris rings making lens switching quick and convenient. Additionally, the Focus ring features 300º of smooth rotation to help facilitate consistently accurate focusing especially when pulling focus during a shot. 

Control rings work to maintain the right amount of resistance and operating torque in order to help provide the camera operator or assistant with a consistent feel and predictable lens operation.
Dust and Water Resistant 
The CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is equipped with gaskets and seals for dust and water resistant operation, helping to make them ready for shooting, even in severe conditions.
Minimized Focus Breathing 
The CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to minimize variations in the angle of view while focusing, a phenomenon known as focus breathing. This feature is extremely important while focus pulling, where changes in the angle of view due to focus breathing could become apparent to the viewer.
105mm Front Lens Threading for Screw on Filters 
To allow for additional ease of use and flexibility the CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime lens features threading on the front of the lens to accommodate 105mm screw on filters. This feature allows the camera operator to add filters over the lens without the need for a Matte Box to be attached to the camera system helping to provide flexibility in filter choice as well as the ability to shoot in a more streamlined format.

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon EOS-1D C is flexible, rugged and compact, offering onboard 4K image capture, industry-standard codecs and interfaces, and incredible low-light performance.
<p>
The EOS-1D C features an 18.1-megapixel full frame CMOS image sensor that offers a wide range of image acquisition options, including 4K (4096 x 2160), HD (1920 x 1080), or 18-megapixel (5184 x 3456) still images. The 4K is recorded as Motion JPEG; the HD is recorded as H.264; and the still images are recorded as RAW or JPEG. All of the selected motion imaging formats can be recorded as normal gamma-corrected video or with Canon Log. In addition, like with other Cinema EOS products, the EOS-1D C exhibits incredible low-light performance, ensuring optimum image quality under conditions of extremely low scene illumination, essential for natural-looking image capture when shooting in challenging environments.

		<description><![CDATA[The Sony PMW-F55 CineAlta 4K Digital Cinema Camera features an 8.9MP Super 35mm image sensor, capable of capturing 4K, 2K and HD resolution video in a variety of formats via the camera's internal recorder. The F55 is among the first digital motion picture cameras with a global shutter, which completely eliminates motion skew and other "rolling" shutter distortions.

In keeping with Sony's mandate on versatility, the F55 will have a native FZ-mount as well as a wide range of lens adapters, such as the included PL-mount adapter allowing a wide range of our PL inventory to be used with it.

Many digital sensors can match and even surpass traditional motion picture film for resolution and low light image quality, but with approximately 14.3 stops of dynamic range, film has maintained an advantage over most digital sensors. However, the F55's exposure latitude is rated at 14 stops of dynamic range, for truly film-like rendering of highlights and shadows. Moreover, the F55 incorporates the same color filter array technology used in Sony's flagship F65, for a color gamut that is even wider than motion picture film.

On-board 4K recording requires high-data rate recording media, and the F55 will use Sony's newly developed SxS PRO+ memory cards. A 128 GB card will provide enough space for approximately 40 minutes of 4K video in the XAVC Intra 422 format. SxS PRO+ cards will also allow on-board recording of 2K video at up to 180 frames per second.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When speed is of the essence, the Kino Flos can be mounted and running in a matter of seconds. They can be taken down and packed just as quickly. That’s what makes this portable fluorescent lighting system suited to field production and documentary work.

The KINO FLO 4BANK System is a soft key or fill source that can be used instead of diffusing light through fabric or bouncing light off foam core, as with conventional HMI or tungsten sources. As a comparison, the 4ft 4BANK is equal to a 1.2K HMI fresnel bounced, with these added advantages:

Lower power consumption
Cooler operation
Better control of light with barn doors and louvers
Uses less set space
Can match to daylight, tungsten or existing fluorescent lighting without filtration]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cinema Zoom Lens CN-E15.5-47mm T2.8 L SP (PL mount) rivals best-in-class zoom magnification and wide-angle focal length range for the Super 35mm format, and is engineered to offer superb 4K optical performance for demanding high-end productions, meeting and exceeding industry standards.

Intended for the working professional, the CN-E15.5-47mm T2.8 L SP lens has markings on angled surfaces and on both sides of the barrel, making it easy to read settings from behind, or from either side of the camera. Focus markings can even be switched from standard labeling to metric, depending on production need. This lens is equipped with control rings designed to maintain the proper amount of resistance with consistent operating torque, and a covered flange-back adjustment mechanism to meet numerous of production application needs.

Designed to fulfill contemporary 4K production standards, this phenomenal lens surpasses the performance requirements of any HD imaging system. It features advanced optical design with fluorite and large aspherical lens elements to achieve sharp, consistent images throughout their zoom range. Canon engineers also incorporated geared inner focusing to minimize focus-induced changes in the angle of view, reducing focus breathing virtually to zero. The 11-blade aperture diaphragm ensures smooth out-of-focus areas, while innovative glass construction counteracts barrel expansion and contraction to avoid temperature-induced marking discrepancies.]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[The PMW-F55’s Sony 4K image sensor captures a true 4K 4096 x 2160 DCI-standard cinema image. Its 4K CMOS sensor features 11.6 megapixels (total) and 8.9 megapixels (effective). The “Frame Image Scan” technology used by F55 sensor eliminates flash band and image artifacts common to conventional CMOS sensors. This sensor captures with an impressive 14 stops of exposure latitude with excellent sensitivity and low noise. The F55 image sensor is also equipped with the same advanced color filter array technology used in Sony’s flagship F65, which delivers color gamut that’s wider than 35mm motion picture print film.
The F55 CineAlta camera provides the choice recording of three formats to SxS cards: MPEG-2, 50Mbps HD422 plus two 10-bit mastering formats: XAVC at HD, 2K & 4K resolution, plus SR Codec (HDCAM SR) at 440Mbps or 220Mbps. 16-bit Linear 2K/4K RAW recording to the optional AXS-R5 recorder preserves the greatest latitude for color correction and other post processes. Sony’s 16-bit recording captures 16x more tonal values than 12 bit RAW. Thus it’s the ideal acquisition format for the 16-bit linear Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) workflow.
The F55 features high frame-rate on-board XAVC HD and 4K recordings up to 60 fps, plus a free planned upgrade to XAVC, QFHD up to 60 fps in addition to XAVC 2K/HD up to180 fps. It also offers 240 fps 2K RAW with the optional AXS-R5 outboard recorder and a planned upgrade, achieving the highest frame rates most productions will need, while retaining exceptional, 16-bit image quality.
Simultaneous RAW and onboard camera SxS recording provides a coordinated “off-line, on-line” workflow with simultaneous recording to internal SxS cards and the optional AXS-R5 RAW recorder. For seamless conforming in post, you get matching time code, start frame, stop frame, and file names.
The F55 is equipped with Sony’s large diameter, robust, FZ-mount which is compatible with virtually all 35mm DSLR, and Cine lenses with simple inexpensive lens adapters. It ships with a PL-mount compatible with Cooke/i and Arri LDS.
The F5/F55 excellent camera ergonomics enable comfortably shooting for long periods of time. The camera head, viewfinder and shoulder mount can be adjusted to fit any shooter and optimized for different lens configurations. Their clean, flexible architecture enables shooting in many configurations.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[Shoot True Digital Film, The digital film camera that's always with you!

The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera is a true high dynamic range film look camera in an extremely portable size, so now you can shoot cinema quality in situations never before possible! Imagine shooting a documentary, episodic television production, television commercial or independent film in the true quality of digital film. With its extremely compact size, you can covertly shoot important and historic events such as wars, protests and other conflict in cinema quality and get a more realistic record of the event. Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera is a true revolution in how you can shoot digital cinema!


Wide Dynamic Range, Retain more image detail for more color grading power

Regular video cameras shoot limited dynamic range, which is why their pictures look like video. Digital cinema cameras have a much wider dynamic range and is the reason why high end television commercials and feature films look so beautiful. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera delivers a true film look because it captures a super wide dynamic range of 13 stops, so your images look truly cinematic. This means you retain all sensor data for DaVinci Resolve color grading!


Highest Quality, The technology of a digital film camera packed into a tiny size

Precision engineered with state of the art technology, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera takes all the high quality features of a professional digital cinema camera and packs them into an incredibly small size. This premium quality design features a solid magnesium alloy chassis, an MFT mount for interchangeable optics, Super 16 size sensor, 13 stops of dynamic range and high quality ProRes 422 (HQ) and lossless CinemaDNG RAW file formats! Every aspect of the image path has been totally optimized for quality!


Micro Four Thirds Lenses, Flexible lens mount for all types of quality glass

Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera lets you use the most incredible range of lenses. With the Super 16 size sensor you can use a wide range of adapters for film quality Super 16 lenses, or use commonly available low cost Micro Four Thirds lenses and more. With full electronic control of your lens, you can simply point and set iris all on command! The Micro Four Thirds lens mount also gives you the flexibility to adapt to PL or other lens mounts as required.


Record to SD Cards

Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera features a built in SD card recorder that captures stunning ProRes 422 (HQ) and lossless compressed CinemaDNG files to fast SDXC cards. As an open format, it's compatible with most popular NLE software so you get a digital camera that's perfectly designed for post production workflows. When you’ve finished recording you can easily mount the card straight into a laptop, ready for editing. You can even color grade direct from the card with the included DaVinci Resolve Lite! SD cards are commonly available and can be formatted for either HFS+ or exFAT, making them compatible with either Mac OS X or Windows.


Open File Format

Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera records into high quality ProRes 422 (HQ) and lossless compressed CinemaDNG files so you retain fine image detail with wide dynamic range for amazing images. This means that Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera is one of the few cameras to support true open file formats, so you're not locked into a strange file format that your editing software can't handle. You get two dynamic range settings, film Log or video REC709, so you can choose the right dynamic range for your project. Using DaVinci Resolve Lite you can color correct files natively or transcode them into a different file format to suit your post production workflow.


Ultra Portable Design, Lightweight and incredibly strong

Designed as the world's most compact digital film camera, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera features a lightweight, elegant design that fits into your pocket. Produced from magnesium alloy for incredible strength, it includes a high resolution LCD for precise focusing and a built in SD recorder, so you get a complete solution without the need to buy expensive accessories. That's vital in such an ultra compact design! With integrated stereo microphones you can also capture great quality sound. The removable rechargeable battery can be swapped quickly, so is perfect when you're on the run!


High Resolution Display, Crystal clear view of your shots

The extremely high resolution 3.5” LCD allows you to monitor while shooting and review recorded files on the SD card. The high resolution screen makes it easy to focus accurately and lets you zoom in to 1:1 size so you focus precisely every time. Camera status displayed at the bottom of the screen shows record status, shutter angle, time lapse interval, aperture setting, ISO, battery level and record time. Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera even includes built in metadata entry.


Professional Connections

The professional connections on the side include a micro HDMI out with optional overlays for easy on set monitoring. You also get a standard mini jack microphone input that's compatible with common AV style microphones, plus a mini jack headphone socket for audio monitoring using headphones. A LANC control input is included for remote operation, and you can power the camera and recharge the removable battery with the 12V DC input.


Ultimate Camera Rig! Build the largest rig for the biggest jobs!

Big cameras can never be small, but small cameras can be big! The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera supports a wide range of adapters for converting from Micro Four Thirds to other lens mounts such as PL. This means you can take advantage of the most amazing professional Super 16 cine lenses as well as any other type of professional lens you want to use. The Micro Four Thirds standard lens mount face is close to the sensor, so you have lots of room to add adapters to other lens types!]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Meeting the ever-increasing demands on image quality that digital photography brings, the redesigned EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM is the latest update to the acclaimed L-Series of EF optics, re-establishing a new standard for superb optics, high-end durable construction and performance in professional zoom lenses. A standard focal length zoom lens, it features a large aperture throughout its focal length. Featuring the latest advances in optical lens design, it utilizes 1 Super UD lens element and 2 UD lens elements that help minimize chromatic aberration in the periphery at wide-angle as well as reduced color blurring around the edges of the subject. In addition, 2 types of aspherical lenses are combined to help reduce spherical aberration over the entire image area as well as through the full zoom range. Optimized lens coatings also help ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting. The lens is also equipped with a circular 9-blade diaphragm for beautiful, soft backgrounds. A ring-type USM and high-speed CPU with optimized AF algorithms enable silent and fast autofocusing. Built for the rigors of professional use as well as to meet the increased number of shots available with digital photography, it's constructed with improved dust sealing and water resistance while fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens surfaces help reduce soiling, smears and fingerprints. A zoom lock lever locks the zoom position at the wide end for safe transporting while attached to an EOS DSLR camera over the shoulder.</SPAN>]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[4K Ready 
The CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to provide outstanding optical performance and is capable of full 4K-Resolution performance. Whether you're shooting in HD with a Canon EOS DSLR camera or in 4K using an EOS C500 Digital Cinema Camera, the CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F will help you to create a cinematic masterpiece by providing superb image quality, contrast and color fidelity.
EF Mount 
The CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime Lenses features a genuine Canon EF mount and works with all Cinema EOS camera models, as well as, all EOS HD-DSLR cameras including Full-Frame models. The EF mount has electronic contacts on both the lens and camera sides that allow direct communication between each device. This communication allows lens metadata including T-numbers to be displayed in the viewfinder. Both the T-number and the focus position are recorded in the video file.
11-Blade Iris 
The use of an 11-blade iris produces artistic and beautiful out-of-focus areas or "Bokeh." The 11 blades allow for attractive circular blurring in out-of-focus regions, while the use of an odd number of blades help reduce flaring of specular highlights. Additionally, the iris ring is mechanically controlle with no click stops for smooth exposure adjustments while recording.
Designed for Cinema Style Lens Control 
Designed to meet the needs of professional cinematographers, the CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime Lens features unified front lens diameters and gear positioning on the focus and iris rings making lens switching quick and convenient. Additionally, the Focus ring features 300º of smooth rotation to help facilitate consistently accurate focusing especially when pulling focus during a shot. 

Control rings work to maintain the right amount of resistance and operating torque in order to help provide the camera operator or assistant with a consistent feel and predictable lens operation.
Dust and Water Resistant 
The CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime Lens is equipped with gaskets and seals for dust and water resistant operation, helping to make them ready for shooting, even in severe conditions.
Minimized Focus Breathing 
The CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to minimize variations in the angle of view while focusing, a phenomenon known as focus breathing. This feature is extremely important while focus pulling, where changes in the angle of view due to focus breathing could become apparent to the viewer.
105mm Front Lens Threading for Screw on Filters 
To allow for additional ease of use and flexibility the CN-E 14mm T3.1 L F Cinema Prime lens features threading on the front of the lens to accommodate 105mm screw on filters. This feature allows the camera operator to add filters over the lens without the need for a Matte Box to be attached to the camera system helping to provide flexibility in filter choice as well as the ability to shoot in a more streamlined format.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[Manageable 4K
Enables a powerful yet manageable workflow for 4K. Ki Pro Quad serves as a central gathering point for the main needs of 4K production; bring camera signals into Ki Pro Quad and then simultaneously create edit-friendly 4K ProRes files, output to 4K monitors and record RAW data directly to Thunderbolt-enabled computer/storage system. 4K content needs are growing. Ki Pro Quad helps ease the transition to 4K with a recorder that creates smaller file sizes while still retaining quality.

HD now, 4K when you need it
Supports 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 recording even at HD and 2K resolutions. Real time scaling from 4K to 2K/HD. Shoot 4K but record 2K to keep file sizes down but still have theatrical quality images to work with. HDMI output allows connection even to HD consumer monitors. Ki Pro Quad can cover your needs today and into the future.

Powerful
New hardware-based features, such as real time, high-quality RAW debayering, recording directly to 4K resolution Apple ProRes files and real time scaling from 4K to HD. Only AJA can deliver advanced features like these in such a compact package.

Affordable
Ki Pro Quad is priced substantially less than other 4K recorders but still has the power and functionality for the demands of 4K productions as well as functionality not found in recorders of ANY price.

Familiar
Ki Pro Quad follows the same tried-and-true principles that have made the rest of the Ki Pro family successful, creating high-quality, low-bandwidth ProRes files up to 4K resolutions, that can be easily offloaded to any Thunderbolt-enabled Mac via AJA's new SSD Thunderbolt reader. The resolution may be different, but the process is the same. And with the same capabilities of Ki Pro Mini for remote control, automation, ease of use and mounting options, the transition to Ki Pro Quad is virtually seamless.

4K and HD Monitoring
At 4K resolution, the ability to check focus and exposure is critical. The only way to do this is with proper, full 4K monitoring. Ki Pro Quad provides a full resolution output that can be fed to 4K monitors for real time, on set quality checks. Real time hardware scaling creates high-quality HD-SDI and HDMI outputs for viewing on consumer and professional HD monitors, giving you additional options.

RAW Support
RAW data is the source from which all other image formats can be generated. This is the equivalent of a camera negative in film terms. Thunderbolt allows the bandwidth to record this RAW data via a single cable to a properly configured drive array. Ki Pro Quad supports RAW data pass-through while simultaneously recording to 4K ProRes files, for the ultimate in data security and flexibility.

Onboard confidence monitoring
The screen on the Ki Pro Quad is located on the same side as all of the user controls so that both the screen and controls are fully accessible even when the Ki Pro Quad is mounted to the camera along with other gear. This provides a quick reference of the input signal as well as the configuration menus. The current status of the Ki Pro Quad as well as all the configuration information is displayed on the built-in screen.

Small enough to mount directly on the camera
4K cameras are no longer giant pieces of machinery. They are as mobile as an HD camera and need a recording device that matches. Ki Pro Quad has the same side profile as the AJA Ki Pro Mini, so the same mounting accessories such as the Mini Mounting Plate can be used to mount the Ki Pro Quad to cameras, rails or whatever the situation calls for.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[PLL-synthesized System
Achieves stable transmission and reception by using a UHF PLL (Phase Locked Loop) frequency synthesized system, which provides accurate carrier signal frequencies. This system is used in both the transmitters and tuners, so that a stable carrier is generated at the transmitter, and accurately tuned in at the tuner. This PLL-controlled system provides highly stable, user-selectable frequencies in increments of 125 kHz.

Space-diversity Reception System
Typically, wireless microphone transmission systems can be subject to reception interruptions (signal dropout), but UWP series tuners reduce this to a minimum. By utilizing a space-diversity reception system, it achieves stable reception by using dual-antenna inputs/reception circuits. These receive signals over two different paths and automatically select the stronger RF signal for output.

Tone Squelch Circuitry
To avoid picking up carrier signals transmitted from other systems, the transmitter transmits a 32 kHz pilot-tone signal along with the audio signal. The tuner's squelch circuit recognizes this tone signal, and outputs the audio signal only when this tone signal is received. This function prevents the output of unwanted signals and noise from other signal transmissions in the air, as well as the RF noise and popping noise that occur when the transmitter is powered on or off.

Simultaneous Multi-channel Operation
Simultaneous operation of up to 16 wireless microphones. Optimum combinations of practically tested, interference-free frequencies are stored in the tuner. By using the pre-programmed frequency groups, users can easily choose interference-free frequencies for the transmitters and tuners, simplifying the task of system setup.

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Now under the umbrella of the Cinema EOS System, Canon is extending the flexibility of digital 4K origination with the EOS-1D C - the first Canon hybrid DSLR to offer onboard 4K motion imaging and Full HD motion imaging on CF cards, in a rugged, ultra-compact form factor. Coupled with Canon's compact EF-mount lenses, the EOS-1D C facilitates 4K image origination in the tightest and most challenging environments, opening up fresh cinematic opportunities along the way.<BR><BR>For anyone familiar with Canon's 5D Mark II or 1D product line, the size and weight of the EOS-1D C will be immediately familiar. The EOS-1D C features an 18.1-megapixel full frame CMOS image sensor that offers a wide range of image acquisition options, including 4K (4096 x 2160), HD (1920 x 1080); or 18-megapixel (5184 x 3456) still images. The 4K is recorded as Motion JPEG; the HD is recorded as H.264; and the still images are recorded as RAW or JPEG. All of the selected motion imaging formats can be recorded as normal gamma-corrected video or with Canon Log. In addition, like with other Cinema EOS products, the EOS-1D C exhibits incredible low-light performance, ensuring optimum image quality under conditions of extremely low scene illumination, essential for natural-looking image capture when shooting in challenging environments. For capturing stills, the EOS-1D C offers the same level of high performance as an EOS DSLR, with top-of-the-range focusing, exposure, and burst mode.<BR><BR>The EOS-1D C is designed to go where other 4K cameras cannot go - into hostile environments, into very cramped spaces, mounted on the end of extended jib arms, or embedded on-set. With onboard 4K recording at 24p or HD recording at a range of frame rates up to 60p; and Clean HD via HDMI, the EOS-1D C offers additional capabilities for film and TV production as well as specialty image acquisition applications. For added versatility, record start/stop can be remotely controlled by EOS Utility Software via a WFT unit.<BR><BR>What&rsquo;s in the box:<BR><BR>EOS-1D C Body<BR>Eyecup Eg<BR>Battery Pack LP-E4N<BR>Battery Charger LC-E4N<BR>Cable Protector and Clamp<BR>Stereo AV Cable AVC-DC400ST<BR>USB Interface Cable IFC-200U<BR>Wide Strap L7<BR>EOS Digital Solution Disk<BR>Software Instruction Manual<BR></SPAN>]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Compact, Durable, Self-Contained 4k Video Recording
The EOS-1D C is an HD video powerhouse providing cinematographers 4K video capture in a single unit, with no need for external power or recording devices. The EOS-1D C is fully self-contained, with the ergonomic ease-of-use portability one expects from a Canon DSLR. Control layout is intuitive for both still and video shooting and the compact size provides an unobtrusive method to getting your desired footage. The EOS-1D C is also fully sealed for protection against dust and moisture.

Canon 18.1 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS Sensor
The EOS-1D C carries the latest generation of Canon's Full-Frame CMOS sensor. With a Full-Frame sensor, Canon EF and EF Cinema lenses will perform to their true potential, while improved signal-to-noise ratio provide clearer shadows and highlights in both bright and low-light environments. Achieve high quality results across the ISO range from 100 to 51200, expandable from ISO 50 to 204800. The sensor in the EOS-1D C also minimizes the rolling shutter effect with a high-speed read across the sensor bus for true-to-life images.

4K Motion JPEG YCbCr 4:2:2, 8-bit video recording
The EOS-1D C is a completely self-contained device that captures 4K video in a cropped-sensor configuration at 24fps in YCbCr color space with a sampling ratio of 4:2:2 and 8-bit depth. Color and luminescence are preserved, while footage can easily adapt to existing post-production workflows without conversion. 4K video can be monitored on the camera's rear LCD, or HD video can be output via HDMI to an external recorder for proxy editing. 4K files can also be played in native resolution using the EOS MOVIE Player.

Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors
The EOS-1D C utilizes dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors for stunning speed and image quality. Each DIGIC 5+ Image Processor contains twin 4-channel A/D converters for outstanding image quality, and refined algorithms reduce noise at high ISO values. The EOS-1D C also applies real-time correction of chromatic aberration and other optical artifacts based on data stored in-camera. Lens data can be added and deleted by using the included EOS Utility software.

Canon Log Gamma
Canon Log Gamma is a setting that sets the EOS-1D C to maximize dynamic range and provide a wide exposure latitude. The files produced using log format are ideal for post-production processes where corrections, color matching, and grading are applied, providing users with a high level of creative freedom in post-production without substantially degrading image quality. When using Canon Log, the EOS-1D C can provide a dynamic range of up to 800%.

HDMI Output with Time Code
The EOS-1D C offers several new capabilities via HDMI output. Connect via HDMI to an external video recorder and output uncompressed YCbCb 4:2:2 8-bit video footage. Output frame rate is independent of shooting rate, allowing it to be matched to the capabilities of the external recorder. HDMI output supports Full HD video, even when recording 4K video to the on-board CF cards. Time code is embedded into the footage for easy synchronization of audio or visual effects. Camera control is also enabled via HDMI; the transport controls on the external recorder can be used to control the camera remotely. In addition, footage can be previewed simultaneously on the camera's LCD monitor and via the HDMI output for multiple monitoring options.

		<features><![CDATA[4K Ready 
The CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to provide outstanding optical performance and is capable of full 4K-Resolution performance. Whether you're shooting in HD with a Canon EOS DSLR camera or in 4K using an EOS C500 Digital Cinema Camera, the CN-E 24mm T1.5 L F will help you to create a cinematic masterpiece by providing superb image quality, contrast and color fidelity.

EF Mount 
The CN-E 35mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lenses features a genuine Canon EF mount and works with all Cinema EOS camera models, as well as, all EOS HD-DSLR cameras including Full-Frame models. The EF mount has electronic contacts on both the lens and camera sides that allow direct communication between each device. This communication allows lens metadata including T-numbers to be displayed in the viewfinder. Both the T-number and the focus position are recorded in the video file.

11-Blade Iris 
The use of an 11-blade iris produces artistic and beautiful out-of-focus areas or "Bokeh." The 11 blades allow for attractive circular blurring in out-of-focus regions, while the use of an odd number of blades helps reduce flaring of specular highlights. Additionally, the iris ring is mechanically controlled with no click stops for smooth exposure adjustments while recording.

Designed for Cinema Style Lens Control 
Designed to meet the needs of professional cinematographers, the CN-E 35mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens features unified front lens diameters and gear positioning on the focus and iris rings making lens switching quick and convenient. Additionally, the Focus ring features 300º of smooth rotation to help facilitate consistently accurate focusing especially when pulling focus during a shot. 

Control rings work to maintain the right amount of resistance and operating torque in order to help provide the camera operator or assistant with a consistent feel and predictable lens operation.

Dust and Water Resistant 
The CN-E 35mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is equipped with gaskets and seals for dust and water resistant operation, helping to make them ready for shooting, even in severe conditions.

Minimized Focus Breathing 
The CN-E 35mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime Lens is designed to minimize variations in the angle of view while focusing, a phenomenon known as focus breathing. This feature is extremely important while focus pulling, where changes in the angle of view due to focus breathing could become apparent to the viewer.

105mm Front Lens Threading for Screw on Filters 
To allow for additional ease of use and flexibility the CN-E 35mm T1.5 L F Cinema Prime lens features threading on the front of the lens to accommodate 105mm screw on filters. This feature allows the camera operator to add filters over the lens without the need for a Matte Box to be attached to the camera system helping to provide flexibility in filter choice as well as the ability to shoot in a more streamlined format.

		<description><![CDATA[While the PL 85-300 is similar in size and weight as the PL 19-90, its longer focal length makes it ideal for shooting documentaries, nature and wildlife, and car commercials, among other demanding production scenarios. The PL 85-300 offers a focal length of 85-218mm at T2.9 and 300mm at T4.0, with 200-degree focus rotation.

Designed using the latest optical simulation technology, the PL 85-300 Cabrio not only offers exceptional optical performance in the center of the image but in the corners of the frame as well. Like the highly acclaimed PL 19-90 Cabrio, the PL 85-300 is equipped with the same indispensable features including flange focal distance adjustment, a MOD of 1.2m, a macro function for objects as close as 97cm (38-inches), and covers a 31.5mm diagonal sensor size.

The digital servo’s 16-bit encoding assures operators that all lens data output—such as the position of the zoom, iris, and focus—is extremely accurate and the lens supports Lens Data System (LDS) and /i metadata formats. Like the PL 19-90 Cabrio, the PL 85-300 features an exclusive detachable servo drive unit, making it suitable for use as a standard PL lens or as an ENG-style lens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All of the hallmarks of a traditional Fresnel light are present in the Zylight F8; Single shadow beam shaping through barn doors, continuous focusing and a smooth light field. The Zylight F8 is extremely compact, durable and the most versatile Fresnel light ever built. This rental version has a daylight 5600K color temperature.
<p>
<b>Field Friendly</b></br>
The Zylight F8 can be powered by either a worldwide AC power adapter or a standard 14.4V camera battery for complete portability. Its thin design and shape allow it to pack into small cases and be taken anywhere. The water-resistant IP54 rating ensures the F8 will be comfortable in falling rain or snow, and blowing dirt and dust. Whether you're shooting a stand-up in a hurricane or snow storm, the F8 will deliver the bright light you need.
<p>
<b>Ultra Bright Output</b></br>
The F8's advanced ultra bright LED module ensures excellent skin tones and rich, accurate color rendition. Continual focusing and an adjustable beam spread between 16-70 degrees allows for even coverage when shooting with wide-angle lenses or HD 16x9 format. The F8 uses a high quality glass 8.0" Fresnel lens and has an equivalent output of a traditional 650 watt instrument. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Sony&rsquo;s new PMW-300K1 XDCAM camcorder is the first semi-shoulder mount camcorder to combine the benefits of 1/2-inch type Exmor&trade; Full HD 3CMOS sensor technology with 50Mbps HD recording at MPEG HD422, meeting broadcast standards around the world. The high bit rate ensures excellent capture of fast moving objects, while its chroma subsampling feature is perfect for a wide range of video recording situations. <BR><BR>Although the PMW-300K1 features the same lens and imager as the PMW-EX3, Sony has developed advanced signal processing technology to suppress noise effectively and create noticeably clearer images, and enable it to reproduce better S/N ratio than that of the PMW-EX3. In addition to the list of exceptional features the new PMW-300K1 shares with the PMW-EX3, the new camcorder now offers Cache Recording of up to 15 seconds, 1/16 ND filter position in addition to 1/4 and 1/64, more Gamma selections, eight assignable switches, QHD 960 X 540 resolution viewfinder, second SDI output, HDMI output, USB connectivity and more. The newly added USB connection enables the wireless remote control, video streaming and high resolution/XAVC proxy file transfer capabilities with an optional CBK-WA100 Wireless Adapter. <BR><BR>The camcorder is designed to be upgradable to support Sony&rsquo;s revolutionary XAVC codec, which is planned to be available late in 2014. This will help to extend the lifecycle of the product and enhance your return on investment*. <BR><BR>* XAVC support for HD will be available in 2014.</SPAN>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Outstanding Performance Designed for 4K Cameras<BR><BR>Applying Fujinon optical technologies developed for the HK Premier Series, ZK Light Weight Series lenses have achieved both a compact size and light weight design. With newly developed HT-EBC multi layer coating technology, the lenses boast a high transmittance and are resistant to flares and ghosts. The lenses employ a &ldquo;3 Moving Zoom Group&rdquo; technology, which is used in HK Premier Series lenses, to compensate for aberrations at all focal lengths.<BR><BR>ZK Light Weight Series lenses exhibit high resolution in the center as well as the corners on a large screen. Fujinon ZK Light Weight Series lenses with high optical performance designed for today&rsquo;s 4K cameras are the answer to the diverse needs of high resolution cinematography production.<BR><BR>ZK Light Weight Series lenses feature advanced &ldquo;Detachable&rdquo; drive unit, first in the Light Weight Zoom category. These lenses feature hybrid technology of our broadcast and cine lens technologies in a light weight and compact body. With the drive unit, these lenses can be operated like traditional ENG TV lenses thanks to the same interface and accessories. This is exceptionally helpful in simplifying and reducing set up time. Therefore, it is not necessary to use more complicated cine lens drive systems. In addition, the drive also seamlessly interfaces with wired and wireless cine control systems.<BR><BR>On the other hand, with the drive unit removed, these lenses have standard 0.8 cine gearing, allowing for the use of traditional third party cine accessories. Whichever way they are used, the operator will feel comfortable with the lenses.</SPAN>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<SPAN STYLE= "" >Video 18 S1 Fluid Head<BR>The S1 fluid heads are the latest models of the two legendary Sachtler Video 18 and Video 20 ENG / EFP series. Now with 6 steps more, the Video 18 S1 has a 16-step counterbalance and enables extremely fine tuning for the camera users. The fluid head now also has a Boost Button for a quick payload range shift and is therefore not only suitable for conventional usage in the ENG areas with digital and HDV camcorders, but also suitable for DSLR camera shooting HD videos with a film-like setup and appropriate accessories. Sachtler's well-proven Speedbalance technology enables quick and fine adjustment.<BR><BR>ENG 2 CF Tripod<BR>These tripods are top sellers for good reasons. The ENG 2 CF is extremely lightweight, solid and stable.

		<description><![CDATA[Ultra-portable and easy-to-use all-in-one live production solution

The AWS-750 Anycast Touch is a compact, affordable, all-in-one live production solution with intuitive touch panel operation. Anycast Touch instantly makes live production accessible to anyone who requires live broadcasting or webcasting. The portable system is designed to be incredibly easy to use. With no previous live production experience required, it is ideal for a wide range of users, such as houses of worship, educational and government institutions, corporate organizations and event management companies. And as you can expect from Sony, Anycast Touch offers clear and detailed pictures for live production.

Anycast Touch eliminates the need for any of the hardware typically required for professional live streaming. It includes a video switcher, streaming encoder, video recorder, audio mixer, clip player, remote camera controller and titler that supports ten languages. The Anycast Touch allows for seamless video mixing between a number of video sources in a variety of formats. You can record ten hours of video and audio on the internal SSD, create and add graphics elements to the image, control connected remote BRC cameras (pan, tilt and zoom), perform multiple effects and wipes to enhance the production and instantly stream the output over a WAN or the Internet. Additionally, a fully functioned five-channel audio mixer is provided for a separate audio mix.

The Anycast Touch enables intuitive, easy operation, and eliminates the cumbersome setup and signal adjustment process typically required when connecting various devices. Users can also store the setup information of all attached video sources, such as the camera input, title data, and transition effects. Additionally, scene lists can be prepared beforehand, allowing users to simply switch scenes during an event with just a single tap.]]></description>

		<features><![CDATA[File-Based Recording
The PIX 270i file-based video deck delivers the performance, quality, and reliability required for fast-paced studio, live sports, event, and mobile multi-camera production. It seamlessly replaces existing tape-based and disc-based video decks and provides a cost-effective and compact alternative to complex video servers.

Extensive Video I/O
Extensive network connectivity and multi-unit synchronization support grouping multiple PIX recorders over Ethernet for simultaneous frame-accurate multicam recording and playback. The PIX 270i can group with other PIX 270i recorders, as well as PIX 260i, and PIX 250i units, with all of the recorders functioning as a single system. The grouped recorders can be controlled two ways: directly through the PIX hardware interface or via a browser accessing the embedded built-in web-based control panel.

Simultaneous or Sequential Recording to Four Drives
The PIX 270i records and plays back either Quicktime video or audio-only WAV files to removable 2.5-inch solid-state drives (drives and PIX-CADDY 2 are optional accessories). Recording to multiple drives offers immediate file backup, eliminating time-consuming post-record copying.

Frame Synchronized
Frame synchronized transport control between multiple grouped PIX 270i's. Record, Play, Stop, Pause, Jog (frame by frame), Shuttle, Fast Forward and Rewind.

Advanced Metadata Editing
Edit scene, take, notes, track names and circle metadata for next take, current take and previous takes even while recording. All edits ripple across all drives being recorded to.

PIXNET Network Control
The PIX 270i can be controlled from browser-capable computers and tablets. When connected to a data network, transport controls and setup menu controls are available on PIXNET. PIXNET offers control of one or multiple PIX 270i recorders. Multiple units can be grouped for simultaneous control.

Remote Control
Record, play, stop, fast-forward, rewind, shuttle, jog, and locate control is available over RS-422. Remote control further enhanced by GPIO ports and standard USB keyboards. USB keyboards also offer menu navigation and text entry.

64-Track Audio
The PIX 270i has extensive audio I/O, plus an audio-only record and playback mode. Up to 64-tracks (32 tracks at 96 kHz) can be recorded and routed from the following sources:
Eight line-level, analog
Eight AES digital
16 channels of embedded SDI
Eight channels of embedded HDMI
64 channels of audio-over-Ethernet using Audinate's Dante
64 channels of MADI

Playback Control
The PIX 270i offers a wide range of playback features. Playback control includes off-speed, forward, reverse, jog, shuttle, freeze-frame, looping, and custom playlists. File markers can be set either while recording or playing back with the press of a button. Loop playback offers continuously looped playback of whole files or between files markers. Playlists help organize multiple files for consecutive or loop playback.

IPS Preview Monitor
With its 5-inch, IPS display, the PIX 270i becomes an accurate video signal evaluation monitor. The display’s excellent color accuracy and off-axis visibility assist in framing, exposure evaluation, and focus evaluation, both during recording and playback.
Defeatable detail overlays on the picture includes audio metering, time code, file type, record status, and frame rate information. The display also doubles as a fast, simple menu interface.
Time Code and record status display can be over-layed on the SDI and HDMI outputs.

Drag and Drop Transfer
Drives connected to a PIX 270i are accessible on Ethernet-based networks as read and write SMB shares, opening up endless possibilities for file sharing. Files can be copied to or from any PIX 270i located on a network, from access across a room or across the globe. Drives can be automaticaly switched to Ethernet when they are full.

Time Code Generator with Genlock
The internal, high-accuracy Ambient time code generator makes the PIX 270i at home on complex, multi-camera and sync-sound productions. All common time code frame rates and modes are supported. Embedded time code over SDI and HDMI is also supported.

Scaler and Frame Rate Converter
The PIX 270i features a hardware scaler and frame rate converter. Up, down, cross-conversion, and pulldown removal give users the ability to record files in a customer-requested rate, even rates not supported by the camera. The PIX 270i also supports aspect ratio conversion, HD to SD and SD to HD.

PowerSafe and Dual Power Supplies
PowerSafe circuitry provides a constant 10-second power reserve. In the event of power loss, the PIX 270i continues to operate for up to 10 seconds, then cleanly stops any file operation and safely shuts down. The PIX 270i draws 10-27 VDC through a four-pin XLR connector. A secondary connection allows connection to redundant power supplies.

Rack-Mountable
PIX 270i's convenient 1/2-rack, 2U chassis dimension allows it to be easily integrated into any existing environment. It is powered by 10-27 VDC through its four-pin XLR connector.
The PIX-RACK (sold separately), includes one full 19" 2U rack (holds two PIX 270is), one blank panel and screws.

		<description><![CDATA[ARRI proudly introduces AMIRA, a versatile documentary-style camera that combines exceptional image quality and affordable CFast 2.0 workflows with an ergonomic design optimized for single-operator use and extended shoulder-mounted operation. Ready to pick up and shoot straight out of the camera bag, AMIRA is hardy enough to take anywhere and features in-camera grading with preloaded 3D LUTs, as well as 200 fps slow motion. It is suitable for a great variety of production types, from reportage and corporate films to TV drama and low-budget movies, so wherever you are headed and whatever you need to shoot, let AMIRA be your companion.
<p>
AMIRA records Rec 709 or Log C images using ProRes LT, 422, 422HQ or 4444 codecs. Camera speeds of up to 200 fps allow full-quality slow motion pictures of staggering clarity and detail to be captured. By recording to in-camera CFast 2.0 flash memory cards with super-quick data rates, the route into postproduction
is made as simple as possible. CFast 2.0 is an open format, delivering a fantastic price-performance ratio through incredible transfer speeds, long recording times and compatibility with standard IT tools. Costs per GB are brought right down and higher-than-broadcast-quality image pipelines are made available even to low-budget productions.

		<description><![CDATA[The α7S is a full frame interchangeable lens camera with an unbelievable 15.3 stops of dynamic range. ISO sensitivity up to 409,600 reveals astonishing detail and color even in the dead of night. Video excels with Full Pixel Readout, a 4K-optimized sensor and uncompressed 4K output via HDMI.

The innovative α7S features a 12.2 effective megapixel 35mm Exmor CMOS sensor paired with a powerful BIONZ X image processor. The α7S can shoot at a sensitivity range of ISO 100 – 409600 with low noise and unprecedented 15.3 stops of dynamic range. The extra-large pixels on the α7S collects dramatically more light than traditional cameras to produce beautifully detailed, low-noise images in even the most challenging lighting environments.

This camera is the world’s first 35mm camera to incorporate ‘direct pixel readout’ utilizing the entire width of the full-frame image sensor without line skipping or pixel binning. Therefore in both HD and 4K video acquisition it can read and process data from every one of the sensor’s pixels. This allows video shooters to utilize all of the artistic and creative benefits provided by the unique sensor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The RED EPIC DRAGON has a 6K sensor capturing over 9x more pixels than HD, unrivaled detail and impressive native exposure eclipsing 35mm film in both latitude and image density.

Bigger Is Better. From large objects to granular textures, 6K images cultivate the nuance of every image, leaving nothing behind. Improvements to micro-contrast and MTF produce a cleaner image, drastically reducing moiré and aliasing artifacts. When outputting 6K files to 4K or HD, your image will appear more refined and detailed compared to those captured at lower resolutions.

A New Look. A new sensor means a new look, and REDCINE-X PRO gives you all the tools you need to dial in your image the way you want it. With its latitude at 6K resolution, you can play with color, curves, and composition with less limitations than ever before. Now with the introduction of the RED ROCKET-X card, your RED workflow just got 5x faster than ever before. REDCINE-X PRO harnesses the power you need to tame your 6K EPIC DRAGON footage.

New Color Science. The new RED DRAGON sensor features their most advanced color science yet, taking advantage of vastly improved dynamic range and low-light capabilities. Skin tones are softer, primary colors are more vibrant, and subtle color variations are discernibly remarkable. EPIC DRAGON cameras capture images that are true to life, with colors that can only be described as "brilliant".

Higher Dynamic Range. The RED DRAGON offers dynamic range that was once thought impossible for a digital sensor. Such wide latitude provides cinematographers and photographers alike with the ability to take on challenging lighting conditions, without the need for excessive filtration. Improved low-light capabilities let you shoot at ISO 2000 and still produce a clean image fit for theaters or publication. Dilated exposure and improved sensitivity makes it easier to take on the unpredictable and capture the unbelievable.

Blazing Fast. The EPIC DRAGON clocks 100 fps at full 6K resolution, merging the worlds of hi-speed with hi-resolution. For even faster speeds, simply drop your resolution and take advantage of maximum speeds of up to 150 fps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The DP7-PRO High Bright Field Monitor features a 1500 nit, 720p IPS LCD which is 3x brighter than traditional LCD displays. Having a screen this bright makes it easy to monitor outdoors—especially if the camera operator is unable to utilize a sun hood (i.e. Steadicam rig).

Complete color control via 3D LUTs.
In addition to many camera specific presets for REC 709, the DP7-PRO is able to detect and display your custom 3D LUTs from any color grading application, allowing you to view a graded image in real time.

The X-Port factor.
The DP7-PRO High Bright and OLED Field Monitors have a discreet expansion port on the back that allows for clean, bulk-free integration with accessories such as the Paralinx Wireless Dock.

		<description><![CDATA[OLED displays have much higher color reproduction capability (”gamut”) compared to LCD displays. This gives the DP7-PRO the required range to accurately display industry standard color spaces such as REC 709 for broadcast/web and DCI-P3 for digital cinema. 

The DP7-PRO OLED field monitor matches the color capability of color grading monitors like the Flanders CM170.

Complete color control via 3D LUTs.
In addition to many camera specific presets for REC 709, the DP7-PRO is able to detect and display your custom 3D LUTs from any color grading application, allowing you to view a graded image in real time.

A truly amazing picture.
The DP7-PRO OLED Field Monitor has great contrast and rich color. This is a result of OLED’s ability to produce “true black” (no “glow”) and a high color gamut. Combined with the color engine of the DP7-PRO, operators are able to produce the image they need (or their client wants).

Work faster with Smart Keys.
The DP7-PRO Field Monitor allows operators to
assign up to 24 functions to “Smart Keys” for
instant access. This prevents the need to enter the
menu system, saving time & sanity. 

Detailed customization of features assigned 
to Smart Keys is accessed with an intuitive
press-and-hold operation.

Highlights:
Custom Look Support (3D-LUTs)
High Color Gamut via OLED Technology

		<description><![CDATA[The Celeb® 400 DMX LED is one of the largest LED soft lights available in the market today measuring 45” x 14” 
(114.5cm x 36cm). Similar in size to the award-winning 4ft 4Bank, the Celeb produces a soft, broad wraparound light quality 
(PRI 95) and produces color faithfully, beautifully on HD or film, in the studio or on location. 

The Celeb boasts technical innovations: dial-in white light from 2700 to 5500 Kelvin and presets with programmable settings;
full range dimming without flicker or color shift. Light levels do not change when selecting Kelvin settings. 

The Celeb 400 DMX operates at universal input from 100VAC-240VAC. The slim profile fixture produces more lumens than a 
1K tungsten soft light, yet uses only 1.8A (120VAC) compared to a tungsten softlight at 8.3A. The Celeb 400 can also be powered by 24VDC battery.

		<description><![CDATA[The MOVI M15 is a camera stabilization system that uses three motors to detect and counteract unwanted movement along three axes: pan, tilt, and roll. It works to compensate for handshake or vehicle-induced vibration. It supports payloads up to 15 pounds, making it suitable for professional cinema cameras with lenses.

The system supports single- or dual-operator control. In single user mode (Majestic), the system's software intelligently differentiates unwanted shake or vibration from intentional movement, such as panning, while keeping the horizon level. Alternatively, you can have a dedicated operator with a remote control who is in charge of camera pan, tilt, and if you want, roll. In this configuration, the camera will always point where the operator of the remote tells it to, independent of how the rig operator moves.

As with the M5 and M10 stabilizers, the Movi M15 is a complicated system which takes practice and finesse. Be sure to give yourself time to set the Movi up properly and properly balance the camera and your footage will be like nothing you have done before.

MAJESTIC MODE 
Single operators can intuitively control the direction of the gimbal using the MōVI’s handles without sacrificing stability. Operators can customize their settings using the Freefly Configurator to get the feel just right for different scenarios they encounter.

DUAL OPERATOR MODE 
Realize the added control with the ability of operating remotely with a second person. This allows one operator to concentrate on framing and the other on maneuvering, allowing for unrestricted and incredible camera moves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The VariCam 35 features superb image handling in multiple formats ranging from pristine 4K RAW to 4K, UHD, 2K, HD and ProRes capture formats making it an unparalleled tool for high-end filmmaking, commercials and episodic production as well as live 4K events. The Camera includes AU-V35C1G s35mm 4k camera head, the AU-VREC1G recorder, AU-VCVF1G OLED viewfinder, and the AU-VSHL1G shoulder pad/tripod mount.

The VariCam 35 utilizes a new Panasonic super 35mm MOS sensor for 4096 x 2160 (17:9) 4K image capture; this imager when combined with the AVC-ULTRA codecs for 4K enables very manageable and practical 4K production file sizes. The new imager boasts an impressive 14+ stops of latitude, and faithfully captures high-contrast, wide dynamic range imagery without compromise.

The VariCam offers a choice of codecs: the well-established Apple ProRes 4444 and ProRes 422 and Panasonic's AVC-ULTRA family of advanced video codecs. The camera/recorder delivers an unprecedented breadth of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100/200 and ProRes.

Addressing the need for high-speed file exchange, the camera encodes a high-resolution 3.5Mbs proxy in parallel with 4K and 2K production formats, enabling fast, efficient offline editing. Metadata management will also be available and any metadata is written to all recording formats to enable easy match-back to high resolution or 4K master files.

The VariCam 35's In-Camera Grading feature is fully flexible, with the camera able to record an ungraded 4K master (with associated metadata grading information) and graded (baked in) HD image simultaneously. Powerful color management capabilities provide a much extended color gamut for impeccable image fidelity, and permit support for an Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) workflow for full fidelity mastering of original source material.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ki Pro established a new paradigm for tapeless video recorders by being the first recorder to offer support for creating Apple ProRes 422 files, which revolutionized how footage could be moved efficiently from production to editorial. Editors are able to work with footage immediately without the need for special file importers or transcoding steps. The workflow is simple: record with the Ki Pro, remove the the KiStor Storage Module from the Ki Pro and connect the KiStor Storage Module to the edit system via built-in connectivity.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Unify formats - speed workflows
AJA's high-quality up/down/cross-conversion makes it easy to unify SD, 720p, and 1080i and create a single desired format for your project. The multitude of video and audio connections such as SDI, HDMI and analog make integrating Ki Pro with other production equipment easy.

RS-422 Control
RS-422 control allows Ki Pro to integrate easily with supported editing systems and external controllers allowing it to fulfill several of the functions of a traditional VTR. Supported NLEs can even perform assemble edits directly to the Ki Pro.

Ki Pro's RS-422 control can also be used to link a traditional VTR with Ki Pro for direct editing control. Use the editing controls on properly equipped VTRs to control Ki Pro for machine-to-machine transfer of video and audio. This allows tape footage to be captured directly as files on Ki Pro without the need for a separate edit controller.

10-bit, full raster recording
Big on quality - but not on file size. Recording 10-bit, full raster files, Ki Pro gives you high quality images that easily stand up to post processing requirements - and client scrutiny.

Compared to 8-bit recording devices, 10-bit 4:2:2 recording (when supported by the codec) provides better quantization, giving a superior representation of the original scene and allowing for more flexibility in post production when adjusting color and balance.

By utilizing efficient ProRes codecs, file sizes are kept in check so you won't need to blow your production budget on extra storage.


Connectivity
Ki Pro's extensive connectivity ensures that you will be able to interface with virtually any gear in your production workflow. The rear panel is packed with connectors which include: SDI input/output, HDMI input/output, component analog input/output, balanced and unbalanced analog audio input/output, LTC input/output as well as LANC.Content


Reliable storage media
Ki Pro captures directly to reliable AJA KiStor media. KiStor media are available as HDDs or SSDs in a variety of capacities to best suit the demands of your production environment. KiStor modules also feature built-in FireWire 800 or USB 3.0 connectivity for direct connection to your editing system using standard interfaces. KiStor media may also be used with the optional KiStor Dock which features a Thunderbolt™ connection for lightning-fast data transfers.

Remote configuration and operation
On set or in a machine room, Ki Pro is equipped for advanced remote control and configuration. With a standard Ethernet LAN connection to a host computer and any web browser, all Ki Pro parameter settings, clip selection and transport controls can be controlled; no additional or special software installation is required on the host computer. Multiple Ki Pro units can even be controlled from a single web interface making Ki Pro an ideal solution for multi-camera recordings. Complete developer tools are also available allowing advanced users to script and automate Ki Pro for custom applications.

Familiar controls and operation
Just like a traditional tape deck, Ki Pro features straightforward and dedicated transport buttons - record, play, stop, rewind, fast forward - making the device easy to operate with minimal training time. The current status of the system and key configuration information is clearly displayed on the built-in screen. Additional operational information can be found in the STATUS menu which can be accessed even when recording or playing back.

The Ki Pro operating system offers users a flat menu structure that is easy to navigate with menu parameters presented in clear and understandable language.

Automatic Camera Control
Using the Camera Data menu parameter, record start/stop operation can be trigged automatically with select cameras. Even file names can be reproduced on the Ki Pro to match the camera native recordings. Automated start/stop can also be accomplished via LANC when connected to properly equipped cameras.

Ethernet file transfer
Because of its network connectivity, media can be copied to and from Ki Pro over the Ethernet connection. This allows for fast file transfers without the need to physically remove the media from the Ki Pro, which can be especially useful in larger facilities and can cut down on machine room traffic by eliminating the number of people that have to be in the machine room.

		<description><![CDATA[Ki Pro Mini speeds your footage from camera to editorial, connecting
to virtually any SD or HD camera and capturing files in Apple ProRes
422 and Avid DNxHD formats at your choice of quality level, direct to
removable CompactFlash media.
Lightweight and rugged, Ki Pro Mini is designed for a life in the field.
The Mini Mounting Plate attaches to the sides of the Ki Pro Mini
and provides almost endless mounting possibilities when used in
combination with battery plates, hot shoe mounts, articulated arms
and more.
Ki Pro Mini works equally well whether your gear uses SDI or HDMI.
The SDI and HDMI outputs are always both active, making the Ki Pro
Mini not just a recorder but a useful converter as well. Two XLR analog
mic/line audio inputs allow on set audio to be recorded directly into
the ProRes or DNxHD files, meaning less work in the edit to synchronize
audio and video from separate sources.
Ki Pro Mini vastly extends your on set capabilities. For rapid playback,
recorded shots can be viewed immediately without the need for
separate video assist equipment.
If you’re using a mobile editing system, footage from Ki Pro Mini can be
edited while you’re still on the set, letting you make sure you have the
right shots before moving on.
Once connected to a camera, Ki Pro Mini requires minimal direct user
interaction. With direct support for Canon, Sony and RED camera data,
record start/stop, timecode and clip naming (if available) can be read
from the SDI signal. On properly equipped cameras, LANC control can be
used for start/stop detection as well. Ethernet connectivity of Ki Pro Mini
allows control and configuration to be performed via web browser at
distances up to 100 feet. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For video facilities transitioning from tape to file-based workflows for
recording and playback, Ki Pro Rack offers high-quality, ‘ready-to-edit’
file capture, designed to get material from source to editorial as quickly
as possible.
With a wealth of professional connections, Ki Pro Rack will fit right into
your existing cabling and routing system without the requirement for
special converters. Ki Pro Rack records Apple ProRes and Avid DNxHD
files at your choice of quality level direct to removable hard disk or
SSD KiStor Storage Modules, eliminating the need for time-consuming
logging and capturing.
Like Ki Pro, Ki Pro Rack features AJA’s industry leading conversion
technology, enabling you to perform broadcast-quality up/down/
cross conversion during recording or playback without the need for
additional conversion hardware.
Anyone familiar with the operation of a tape deck will feel immediately
at home with Ki Pro Rack’s tactile controls, while the flat onscreen
menu structure ensures quick setup and a rapid learning curve.
The twin media drive bays on the Ki Pro Rack allow extremely fast
media changes - you can switch drives and start recording straight
away, without having to swap out the drive modules.
Ki Pro Rack’s network connectivity opens up new methods for
integrating into your facility. Mounted KiStor drives can be accessed via
the remote web interface built into Ki Pro Rack from a web browser on
any computer on the network. This allows files to be transferred to and
from Ki Pro Rack without having to remove the storage media.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The CINE-SERVO 17-120mm T2.95-3.9 lens provides cinematographers and broadcast operations with a compact, lightweight design (only 6.4 lbs.) using Canon optical elements, while offering outstanding performance and reliability in professional shooting environments.

The new lens is fully 4K-ready, with a high optical resolution and support for Super35mm large-format cameras. An 11-blade aperture diaphragm helps ensure an artistic and beautiful representation of out-of-focus areas (or “Bokeh”).

The lens also features a high 7x zoom magnification, wide focal length range of 17mm to 120mm, and a 180º smooth rotating focus ring. Acknowledging that broadcasters often need to control zoom, focus and iris/aperture in different ways than filmmakers, Canon has developed this zoom lens with full external servo control for drama, documentary and other broadcast productions.

The servo drive unit is compatible with industry-standard protocols for control from a number of lens controllers including Canon’s standard broadcast lens controllers (ZSD-300D/FPD-400D) and multiple industry standard cinema lens controllers. The drive unit can be easily removed for cinema-style shoots and can be easily re-attached without any manual re-alignment. A 16-bit metadata output enables connection to virtual studio systems.

		<description><![CDATA[Bringing Canon's expertise and decades of experience designing sensors, lenses, image processing and design to the world of motion picture capture, the EOS C300 camera has been designed to meet the demanding needs of cinema industry professionals, providing a modular, portable and eminently adaptable system of cameras, lenses and accessories built for moviemaking in the 21st century.

The EOS C300 camera with Dual Pixel AF technology features a CMOS sensor that consists of an array of pixels that each feature two separate photodiodes. By continuously comparing their outputs during AF mode, phase-difference autofocus helps ensure non-blurred images and smooth focus transitions even when the talent and/or camera are moving. The new feature places a high priority on maintaining sharp focus while, providing a natural, smooth focus transitions with select Canon autofocus EF lenses – including newer-generation STM lenses – which offer even smoother and quieter operation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon EOS C100 Digital Video Camera brings together the renowned technology of Canon CMOS sensors, DIGIC DV III Image Processor, and EF lens compatibility in a smaller, lighter body. Modular and compatible with a host of Canon and third-party accessories, the EOS C100 brings true cinema quality to independent event videographers and video production organizations.
The EOS C100 camera with Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology features a CMOS sensor that consists of an array of pixels that each feature two separate photodiodes. By continuously comparing their outputs during AF mode, phase-difference autofocus helps ensure non-blurred images and smooth focus transitions even when the talent and/or camera are moving. The new feature places a high priority on maintaining sharp focus while, providing a natural, smooth autofocus movement with select Canon EF lenses – including newer-generation STM lenses – which offer even smoother and quieter operation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the PL 85-300 is similar in size and weight as the PL 19-90, its longer focal length makes it ideal for shooting documentaries, nature and wildlife, and car commercials, among other demanding production scenarios. The PL 85-300 offers a focal length of 85-218mm at T2.9 and 300mm at T4.0, with 200-degree focus rotation.
Designed using the latest optical simulation technology, the PL 85-300 Cabrio not only offers exceptional optical performance in the center of the image but in the corners of the frame as well. Like the highly acclaimed PL 19-90 Cabrio, the PL 85-300 is equipped with the same indispensable features including flange focal distance adjustment, a MOD of 1.2m, a macro function for objects as close as 97cm (38-inches), and covers a 31.5mm diagonal sensor size.
The digital servo’s 16-bit encoding assures operators that all lens data output—such as the position of the zoom, iris, and focus—is extremely accurate and the lens supports Lens Data System (LDS) and /i metadata formats. Like the PL 19-90 Cabrio, the new PL 85-300 features an exclusive detachable servo drive unit, making it suitable for use as a standard PL lens or as an ENG-style lens. And the PL 85-300 can be controlled using cinema industry standard wireless controllers as well as existing FUJINON wired and wireless units.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Diva-Lite 401 is a soft light source ideally suited for Television or Film documentary shooting styles. The unit provides a broad, soft and diffused light. As a cosmetic light source the Diva-Lite 401 is ideal for news presenters reporting from locations around the world. The compact size and rugged lightweight nature make it well suited for travel. 

The Diva-Lite puts out a broad soft wash of light. The drop off is like the light off of a bounce card. For this reason it is most effective in close proximity to the subject. By being close, the light is softer and easily controlled with the built-in barndoors and detachable louvers.
This instrument is proving to be very popular for interviews. It is small enough to travel easily. It is light enough to rig onto lighting stands or onto grip arms. An interview can be done with as little as a single Diva-Lite 401 and a bounce card.

Diva-Lites operate on Kino Flo True Match 55W compact fluorescent lamps. Daylight balanced (KF55) and tungsten balanced (KF32) lamps are available. 

Light level control is established through an onboard dimmer as well as by 2 and 4 lamp switching. 
An in-line power switch controls the power. Louvers provide control over the spread of the light.
The Diva-Lite 401 portable softlights boast the company’s trademark modular fixture designs with full-range dimming, switching and remote control features. The Universal model can be used anywhere in the world from 100VAC to 240VAC. ]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Fixture includes Center Mount, Gel Frame, Louver and built-in barndoors
On location, lamps get to full color temperature in three minutes. 
When finished, turn off power and pack. No need for cool down period.
The lamps can stay in the fixture for quick transport.
All-in-one design with built-in Dimming Ballast
Remote dimmer capability
4-Lamp/2-Lamp switching
Low amperage draw - can plug in to any household outlet
Slim profile ideal for shooting in small offices, hallways, or cramped quarters
The Universal version with auto-sensing power supply can use anywhere in the world.
Same fixture uses 55Watt compact 5500K (Daylight) and 3200K (Tungsten) lamps.
Full spectrum (CRI 95) lamps available in 3200K and 5500K
High color rendering True Match lamps work well alongside conventional quartz lights or HMI's.
Kino Flo 55Watt compact lamps also available in 550nm green and 420nm blue for green and blue screen.
Color gels do not burn out or fade due to low heat of fixture.

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon XF205 Professional Camcorder is a compact, high-performance, high image quality system ideal for use with a variety of digital cinema and broadcast operations. Targeted at sports production, TV variety shows, commercials and drama shows, in addition to independent movie production, government applications, education, weddings and other social event videography, the camcorder features a wide-angle 20x optical zoom lens with three control rings, image stabilization, infrared capabilities, flexible MXF/MP4 dual recording at various data rates, two/four-channel audio recording, Wi-Fi® connectivity, plus 3G-SDI and monitor outputs as well as time code and genlock connections.

A versatile Canon 20x HD wide-angle video lens captures images with outstanding clarity across a broad 26.8–576 mm* zoom range. An eight-blade circular aperture provides natural and visually pleasing bokeh. Three separate rings control focus, zoom and iris settings. A new Five-Axis Dynamic SuperRange OIS System dramatically reduces the image-degrading effects of camera shake, and a new rotating handgrip enables comfortable camera positioning at shooting angles from high to low.

Dual-frequency Wi-Fi® and an Ethernet connector enable browser preview during shoots, in addition to FTP transfer to external servers, PCs or laptops. HD-SDI ports handle video with embedded audio and time code data for monitoring and recording of frame rates up to 30fps, and a new 3G-SDI port supports 1080p video at frame rates up to 60 fps. Time code I/O helps ensure frame-accurate sync during editing and post-production. The XF205 camcorder can also be used with Canon’s new RC-V100 Remote Controller to provide full access to important user functions, including start/stop, zoom/focus/iris, white balance and more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The XA20 is a compact, "run-and-gun" HD camcorder with an impressive optical performance from a powerful new Genuine Canon 20x HD Video Lens with a new 8-Blade Circular Aperture, capable of focusing down to just 23.6 inches (60cm). Other features include a 3.5-inch OLED Touch Panel Display with the equivalent of 1.23 million dots of resolution, tiltable electronic viewfinder, multiple HD/SD recording rates - including 24p for a "cinematic" look - together with a choice of industry-standard MP4 (up to 35 Mbps) and AVCHD (up to 28 Mbps) codecs. The high image quality and recording versatility make the XA20 ideal for independent and documentary filmmaking, as well as event videography and educational institutions.

In addition to reducing horizontal and vertical shaking, five-axis SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization eliminates rolling and other artifacts, for sharper images no matter how the camcorder is moved. A new automatic correction circuit can substantially reduce image distortion, thereby producing better-looking videos.

A detachable handle offers increased control functionality, with a built-in microphone holder and XLR-format audio inputs. Infrared shooting with little to zero ambient light offers additional flexibility during, for example, surveillance and wildlife projects; the detachable handle also includes an IR light.

Dual-band, built-in Wi-Fi® technology allows easy FTP file transfer and upload to the internet. And intelligent lithium batteries report remaining power and battery-wear levels in one-minute increments to the camcorder, thereby taking the guesswork out of battery management.

		<description><![CDATA[The name "NOCTICRON" was newly defined by Leica Camera AG for this lens that achieves remarkably fast F1.2 aperture. The popular 42.5 mm of middle-telephoto focal distance (Equivalent to 85 mm on a 35 mm camera) is definitely suitable for portrait with rich stereoscopic effect. Together with the high-speed aperture, you can utilize the beautiful soft focus for more impressive, creative shots. 9 blades give the aperture a rounded shape that produces a smooth effect in out-of-focus areas when shooting at larger aperture settings
The inclusion of newly developed stepping motor makes the focusing action smooth and silent for use in both photo and video recording. Notably the performance of AF is by far superior to the phase-difference AF when fast lens with smaller F value is used. When mounted on the cameras of LUMIX G, you can take advantage of the high-precision, high-speed Contrast AF system.
With Panasonic's Nano Surface technology the reflection is dramatically minimized at entire visual light range (380nm-780nm) by applying the extra-low refractive index coating with nano-sized structure on the surface of the lens. It results in the super clear picture with dramatic reduction of ghost and flare.
Due to the shallow depth of field which is unique to the large aperture lens, even a slight handshake causes out-of-focus. However, the POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) which is newly integrated in this lens effectively compensates for not only small, fast movement but also large, slow one making it easy to shoot super clear shots even when shooting in low-lit situations such as in night time or indoors.

		<description><![CDATA[The RØDE NTG3 super-cardioid shotgun microphone is designed for professional use on film, television, electronic news gathering and wherever high-resolution broadcast audio is required.

As RØDE's premier directional microphone the NTG3 exhibits superlative audio quality with a rich, warm quality and a full frequency response. Its RF bias technology makes it almost completely resistant to moisture, making it the only option when recording in demanding environments where condensation is an issue.

Machined from solid brass and available in either anti-glare, nickel-plated finish or matte black (NTG3B), the NTG3 is incredibly robust while remaining light weight.

Its precise yet forgiving polar pattern ensures that whether used on-camera or on a boom pole, the NTG3 will capture audio clearly every time.

A durable aluminum storage cylinder is supplied to provide the ultimate protection for the NTG3 while in storage and transport. Tightly sealed at both ends the cylinder is highly weatherproof, adding to the microphone's rugged performance credentials.

The RØDE NTG3 shotgun microphone is designed and made in Australia, and covered by RØDE Microphones' industry leading 10 year warranty.

		<description><![CDATA[Stereo VideoMic Pro provides a high quality stereo option for videographers, and is ideal for recording music, and the atmospheric ambience essential in building a realistic audio scene.

Based around a matched pair of high sensitivity ½”cardioid condenser capsules in a coincident XY pair, the Stereo VideoMic Pro provides a wide stereo image with natural depth.

The Stereo VideoMic Pro builds on the feature set of the VideoMic Pro, with an ergonomic form factor perfectly suited to DSLR, consumer camcorders and large-sensor video cameras. The integrated shock mounting system provides superior isolation from vibration and mechanical noise that can otherwise degrade the recording quality. Additionally the lightweight yet robust multi-strand cable provides excellent acoustic decoupling from the camera and offers significantly lower noise transference than traditional audio cable.

The user friendly designed rear of the microphone body features the power and equalisation controls, including a high pass filter at 75Hz which is designed to cut out the noise generated by air conditioning, traffic and other undesirable low frequency interference.

A -10dB PAD allows the user to reduce the sensitivity of the microphone, making it suitable for recording loud sound sources such as live music or at sporting events.

The Stereo VideoMic Pro features a +20dB level boost specifically designed to provide a higher quality signal with DSLR cameras. When activated, the typically low quality camera preamp level can be reduced, resulting in a lower noise floor and much clearer recording.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The RØDE Lavalier is a discreet lapel microphone that provides broadcast-quality audio when close-miked in almost any scenario.

The Lavalier's low self-noise, user friendly omni-directional polar pattern and minimal appearance make it an ideal solution for film, television, video, theatre, house of worship and anywhere where a high quality microphone needs to be heard but not seen.

The microphone capsule is connected via a 1.2m (4') shielded, detachable Kevlar® reinforced cable that has been rigorously strain tested up to 10kg to ensure reliable performance.

The included mini-furry for high wind protection ensures quality recordings in adverse environments, and the included cable management clips ensure that you are able to minimise the microphone and cable visibility, while providing maximum mobility for the wearer.

The supplied anti-trauma water resistant case provides rugged and secure protection for the microphone, cable, clips and included accessories.

Knowing that versatility is paramount in any product, RØDE has developed the MiCon™ connector system which provides seamless integration between the Lavalier and a wide range of wireless systems as well as consoles, cameras and portable recorders.

		<description><![CDATA[The RØDE Podcaster is a dynamic, end-address USB microphone that combines broadcast-quality audio with the simplicity of USB connectivity, allowing recording direct to a computer without the need for an additional digital interface.

Including an audiophile quality 18-bit resolution, 48kHz sampling A/D converter, the Podcaster processes all of the analogue-to-digital conversion internally, bypassing the computer's lower quality on-board sound controller altogether.

A headphone output on the microphone body provides zero-latency monitoring, so the user can hear exactly what is being recorded, free of delay or echo.

The Podcaster features an internal pop filter, designed to minimise plosives sounds that can overload the microphone capsule and distort the audio output.

It is fully compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac OS X computers, as well as several Linux distributions. The microphone is bus powered and features a status LED to indicate operation.

The Podcaster is ideal for podcasting, vodcasting, YouTube videos, voice recognition software, corporate videos and any production application that requires a simple yet professional voice-over microphone. It is also a convenient demo microphone for musicians and songwriters that prefer the convenience of a USB microphone but don't want to compromise sound quality.

It can also be used as an iPad microphone for the Apple iPad (in conjunction with the iPad Camera Connection Kit and a powered USB hub) to provide high quality recording to various iPad audio applications such as Garageband.

The Podcaster includes a sturdy RM2 microphone ring mount. For professional applications the optional PSM1 shock mount and PSA1 boom arm are highly recommended.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Recoil Handgrip Kit is comprised of a Zgrip Z-Mount Zwivel handgrip, a Z-Drive follow focus and the Zacuto Tornado grip. This kit is perfect for turning your rig into a Recoil rig. A Recoil rig positions the camera directly on top of the operators shoulder (usually with a QR Shoulder Pad) creating a shorter, more balanced traditional style rig. The Recoil Handgrip Kit pushes focusing forward and down for easy accessibility while also providing double handles for stability. This kit attaches to your existing 15mm rods (lightweight or studio spaced) running through a baseplate. 

The Zacuto Z-Drive is a unique, direct drive universal follow focus. It attaches to a single 15mm diameter rod and curves away from the operator at a 60 degree angle creating space and distance from the lens for comfortable use when the camera is on your shoulder. The Z-Drive slides on to the rod and tightens in place next to your lens with a Zacuto quick-release ratcheting red lever. It comes with a fixed 1 ¾” diameter .8 pitch gear to connect to your lens. If your lenses are not pitched to .8 or are not pitched at all (most DSLR and basic video camera lenses are not) you can add our Zipgear Universal to your lens so the teeth match our gear correctly for smooth rotation. The Z-Drive has a slender marking disc to create distance marks for repeatable focus pulls and a standard whip port. 

The Tornado grip attaches to the Z-Drive whip port and works in tandem with the Z-Drive to create a unique mechanical follow focus handgrip. Slide the Tornado grip into the Z-Drive whip port by pushing down on the round plunger and pushing the Tornado into the port. Once you release this plunger it will be securely attached. Grab the horn handle with your bottom three fingers, placing your forefinger and thumb on the scalloped focus wheel. Turn your whole hand to focus. For lenses with a large focus rotation, release your thumb and forefinger, ratchet your wrist back and grab the scalloped wheel once again for more range. 

The Zgrip Z-Mount Zwivel comes with a black 4.5 inch rod and a Z-Mount Zwivel 2 to attach to any 15mm rod. The Zwivel 2 allows you to change the angle between the two 15mm rods at set points turning 365 degrees using a pin locking mechanism. The Zwivel 2 has two levers which control each 15mm hole. In order to change the angle of the rods, just loosen either of the levers and the internal spring separates the parts for you to adjust to the desired angle. The handgrip fully articulates at a ball joint via the red quick release lever.

It includes the EVF Snap model and an optical viewfinder, which will snap onto the frame on the monitor. The optical viewfinder contains high quality 2.5x optics with anti-fog shields. The anti-fog is extremely important for reducing fog. It does not have a diopter but will include the Zacuto Z-Finder Extender Frames. The Extender Frames will get the focus close but might not be exact as you can’t dial it in with a diopter, as you can with our Z-Finder Pro models.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Recoil V2 is the ultimate balanced rig for the Canon C100/300/500. In the Recoil concept, the camera sits directly on your shoulder like a typical ENG camera. The Recoil V2 is super light and stripped down (if you are looking for something even more stripped down, check out the Recoil Lite V2). The Recoil V2 starts with our Studio Baseplate. It attaches to the camera with 3/8” 16 and ¼” 20 screws. There are 12” lightweight spaced 15mm threaded rods running through the Studio Baseplate. These can be extended to hold additional accessories at the front or back of the kit. They can slide back and forth through the plate to accommodate different lens lengths by loosening the two levers on the side of the plate. The Studio Baseplate also features lightweight spaced rod holes on either side of the plate. They accept a female rod end (or Zacuto Zamerican articulating arm) and tighten with an Allen. When sitting on a tripod, you can mount a Zwiss Plate V2 from the rod ports on the side of the baseplate (via two short female/female rods, not included) for better balance. 

Unique to the Recoil system is the use of the Zacuto QR Shoulder Pad. The QR Shoulder Pad is a completely universal curved, padded shoulder pad system. The shoulder pad is designed to sit directly under your camera or baseplate putting the camera on top of your shoulder. The QR Shoulder Pad is a two part system that includes the shoulder pad itself and a separate dovetail plate that screws into the bottom of your camera or baseplate just like an ordinary tripod plate. The shoulder pad is set at an angle and made of form-fitting Akton Polymer pad to settle comfortably into your shoulder. The dovetail plate comes with one (1) ¼ 20 and one (1) 3/8 16 screw in sliding tracks that allows you to position the plate at any point under your baseplate for comfort and balance. The QR Shoulder Pad attaches, positions, and detaches from the dovetail plate with a quick release lever. The dovetail plate can act as a traditional tripod plate and snap directly into a tripod, monopod, slider or other standard piece of equipment.* 

The Recoil also includes our ENG Grip Relocator that positions the C100/300** removable grip at the rods for comfort and convenience. The Canon C100/300 removable grip attaches directly to our Relocator handle and our exclusive right angle cable connects to the port on your camera. Once its plugged in, users have trigger or on/off control, lens aperture control, and a programmable function button that can be set to a number of things including waveform, 1 to 1 zoom, zebras, my menu, and many more. The cable is 24" long. 
The Recoil V2 is a great kit for run & gun style or all day shooting with the Canon EOS C100/C300/C500. It is an extremely versatile kit.

		<description><![CDATA[The C300/500 Z-Finder is an optical viewfinder, specifically designed to attach to the Canon C300 and C500 cinema camera’s LCD screen. This Z-Finder will magnify the LCD screen by 1.8x and has a diopter wheel for specific focus tuning. It cuts out any extraneous light and offers an initial point of stability by pressing your eye against the large eyecup. The Z-Finder includes 4 interchangeable anti-fog glass diopters, 0, +1, +2, and +3 so you can correct it to your vision right out of the box and then fine tune it with our red adjust wheel for perfect clarity. -1 and +4 diopters are available for purchase separately. An aluminum sun mask is built in to the Z-Finder to protect your LCD screen from sunlight.

The C300/C500 Z-Finder is attaches by using a foam padded sleeve that slides over the LCD screen of either the C300 or C500. The sleeve is secured into place with a bar clamp. It also includes a unique monitor lock clip to keep the LCD screen from moving forward when the Z-Finder is pressed against your eye. 

The Mounting Kit for the C300/C500 Z-Finder allows you to position the LCD screen forward and off the the side in a position to better enable shoulder mounted shooting. The Mounting Kit attaches to a Z-Rail mount and will allow forward/backward, side to side, and tilt adjustment of the Z-Finder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Zacuto Z-Drive is a unique, universal direct drive follow focus, designed with single operator shoulder mounted rigs in mind. Because it has a universal joint and no internal gears it can’t develop play. It attaches to a single 15mm diameter rod and curves away from the operator at a 60 degree angle creating space and distance from the lens for comfortable use when the camera is on your shoulder. This is the perfect follow focus for a Recoil kit set up (where the camera is directly over your shoulder) as it brings focus control further forward as well as down for comfortable operation. The Z-Drive can operate in four modes and is extremely adjustable for all size lenses. It can operate on the camera assistant or operators side of the rig positioned forward toward the lens or backward towards the tripod/dolly etc.. This makes for easy operation with a standard follow focus whip used on a tripod. 

The Z-Drive slides onto a single 15mm diameter rod (on the left or right of your camera) and tightens in place next to your lens with a Zacuto quick-release ratcheting red lever. It comes with a fixed 1 ¾” diameter .8 pitch gear to connect to your lens. If your lenses are not pitched to .8 or are not pitched at all (most DSLR and basic video camera lenses are not) you can add our Zipgear Universal to your lens so the teeth match our gear correctly for smooth rotation. The ZipGears can be cut to fit the circumference of your lens and tightened with an Allen key. These ZipGear straps are pitched to .8 and are 13.5” long. 

The Z-Drive has a slender marking disc to create distance marks for repeatable focus pulls and a standard whip port. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The AMP1A-SUM6-RD audio monitor provides self-powered, full-fidelity stereo monitoring of analog audio in the smallest rack space possible (1U) with a mounted depth of just 6.5", six audio input channels on a DB25 connector, and six individual volume controls.
Channels 1/2/3 are summed to the left speaker and channels 4/5/6 are summed to the right speaker.
Each of the six channels may be individually adjusted for volume to allow mixing of the overall output.
The audio amplifier section features five high performance transducers driven by three power amplifiers: two amplifier/driver combinations handle midrange and high frequency information in stereo (left and right speakers), while the third center channel reproduces information below the 500 Hz crossover point (woofer speaker).
Output limiter circuits are incorporated to protect the speakers, and extensive magnetic shielding allows placement immediately adjacent to magnetically sensitive equipment, such as video monitors.
The unit features six input channel volume controls, power indication LED, and headphone output.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The class leading Vision 250 is designed to support the latest portable cameras complete with viewfinders, prompters and pan bar controls and is becoming the standard in new studio production as well as OB/EFP applications. With a choice of easily changeable spherical or flat bases, the Vision 250 can be mounted on any pedestal or tripod, making the Vision 250 head one of the most versatile products in the range.The TF drag system offers infinite adjustment and because it works independently of the balance system, allows precision balancing of the pan and tilt axis so that the effort needed to follow the action becomes totally insignificant.

		<description><![CDATA[Offering the most extensive height range available from heavy duty tripods the HDT-1 single-stage and HDT-2 two-stage models also feature increased torsional rigidity and robustness - ideal for large camera and lens combinations in any studio or OB application.The  pinned and glued telescopic leg design provides a wide range of height adjustment whilst offering superior strength and reliability. Set up has been made even simpler with the addition of engraved leg markings for rapid, even deployment and an integral level bubble allows for fine level adjustment. The new clamping system provides progressive feel to a positive stop which indicates when the leg is locked, ensuring simple and confident clamping. Whatever the terrain, the HDT’s three-position swivel foot ensures a stable base. Choose from an increased length spike for soft surfaces, self-levelling pad for harder surfaces or a socket to fit all Vinten skids and floor spreaders. The mid-level spreader is supplied as standard and ensures that the HDT is a convenient and stable option for any application.  The single piece, fixed length design of the spreader offers exceptional strength and robustness, and is simple to use and remove when necessary. The HDT systems take care of even the smallest details; captive bolts ensure that filming is never disrupted and an integral carry handle provides confortable and easy repositioning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vaddio’s AV Bridge provides integrators the ability to integrate soft codecs such as Skype, Cisco Jabber, Microsoft Lync, as well as many more, into their traditional AV designs. The AV Bridge provides the digital USB gateway to allow the integration of PRO audio and video equipment into any PC software application.

Based on UVC/UAC USB standards, no special USB drivers need to be installed, and as a result, it works seamlessly with any software application running on any operating system that supports USB 2.0 devices. Whether you want to do a Skype video call or need to set up lecture capture using Panopto’s software lecture application, the AV Bridge provides the USB connection to your AV system. Want to record or stream a meeting? Use the recording and streaming software of your choice — and AV Bridge will connect the audio and video sources.

The AV Bridge can support switchable balanced or unbalanced audio — and switchable HDMI, RGBHV, SD or HD component video inputs. Video inputs can be up or down converted as required. Outputs include USB 2.0 with HD UVC/UAC device support - or an Ethernet network interface for both IP control and streaming, supporting RTSP and HLS streaming clients.

The AV Bridge makes it simple to encode, capture and stream your AV content through a variety of PC applications or directly to the network. You now have a true digital gateway to capture, record and stream those legacy analog solutions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ProductionVIEW HD MV is a camera control console with multiviewer capabilities, digital inputs/outputs, HD, RGBHV and SD video mixing, transitions, lower screen graphics and automated control functionality.

With Vaddio’s TeleTouch touch screen monitors, all live video feeds can be selected and up to 12 video thumbnail presets can be created, recalled and stored by simply touching the monitor. The thumbnails are a snapshot of what the camera preset shot looks like, to make storing and recalling presets even easier. Simply touch a thumbnail and the camera will pan, tilt and zoom to that position. The Cut, Wipe and Fade buttons illuminate on the multiviewer display, giving a visual indication of which effect is active.  

The 6 x 2 multi-format, seamless video mixer provides two discrete outputs for dual bus program feeds (two independent 6 x 1 mixers). Input signals include analog HD YPbPr video, RGBHV, SD (Y/C and CVBS), and Input 6 provides a DVI-I input for RGBHV, DVI-D and HDMI.  The Program and Preview outputs have both analog (YPbPr, RGBHV, Y/C and CVBS) and digital (DVI-D and HDMI) outputs. HD resolutions up to 1080/60p are supported.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The HXC-D70 is an HD color video camera equipped with three-chip 2/3-type CMOS image sensors yielding approximately 2.07 million effective pixels for full HD resolution (1920 × 1080). This advanced image sensor technology coupled with the latest digital processing circuitry enables the capture of very high-quality HD images, with a sensitivity of F12 (59.94i) / F13(50i) and an SN ratio of 56 dB (w/o Noise Suppression (NS)mode). Multi-core transmission technology comes standard with the HXC-D70 camera system. But now there are two different signal transmission options for system flexibility – optical fiber and digital triax transmission technologies. For the optical fiber transmission option, the HXC-D70 camera head is mechanically docked with the CA-FB70 camera adaptor that allows the camera to transmit the signals via optical fiber cable to the HXCU-FB70 camera control unit. For the digital triax transmission option, the HXC-D70 camera head is mechanically docked with the CA-TX70 camera adaptor that allows the camera to transmit the signals to the HXCU-100 camera control unit via triax cable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Previously the exclusive domain of feature films and high-end production, 4K is now available for corporate video, event video, education and houses of worship. Because now Sony introduces the PXW-Z100, the one-piece handheld camcorder that makes the phenomenal imagery of 4K available to anyone, anywhere, for any application. With the PXW-Z100 you can shoot incredibly rich, superbly robust 1080p HD, then switch over to 4K (4096 x 2160) or 4K TV-friendly Quad Full HD (3840 x 2160) whenever you need them. Choose frame rates from 24p to 60p. Because the camera uses the same XAVC™ Intra 4:2:2 codec as Sony’s high-end F55, your pictures are superb. Because the ergonomics are based on Sony’s popular handheld camcorders, the operation is friendly and familiar. And because the camera captures 4K, it’s ready for whatever you’re shooting today—and tomorrow.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[4K 60p in a handheld camera With the PXW-Z100, high resolution and high sensitivity go hand in hand. The 1/2.3” sensor boasts 8.8 million effective pixels, while back-illuminated Exmor® R CMOS technology delivers impressive low-light performance. The sophisticated optics of Sony’s 4K-rated G Lens provides a generous 20x zoom, plus a versatile 30mm wide angle (4K mode, 35mm full frame equivalent).
Sony’s amazing XAVC codec The PXW-Z100 boasts the same high-end XAVC™ Intra codec as the F55 digital motion picture camera. You get the power of 4:2:2 color, the dynamic expression of 10-bit recording and the accuracy of all-I-frame encoding, which compresses each frame individually. Based on industry-standard AVC/H.264 compression, XAVC recording is already compatible with leading dailies, editing and color correction tools. You get 4K, QFHD or HD at frame rates from 24p to 60p. The maximum 4K bit rate is 600 Mbps (60p) while the top HD bit rate is 223 Mbps (50/60p).
Advanced XQD memory cards Keeping up with the impressive data rates of XAVC 4K recording takes some equally impressive memory. The PXW-Z100 features two slots for XQD™ memory cards, which have been standardized by the CompactFlash Association. The system takes advantage of the familiar PCI Express interface and a Sony developed controller to support stable recording at up to 600 Mbps. For best performance, we recommend S Series QD-S32E and QD-S64E cards.
Upgrade path to XAVC LongGOP For extended recording time, Sony plans to offer XAVC LongGOP and the popular AVCHD™ codec as a firmware update planned for the middle of 2014. AVCHD files are particularly well suited to the Blu-ray Disc® playback environment.
Relay recording For extended shoots, the PXW-Z100 provides relay recording between the two card slots. You can begin a recording session on one card, then automatically switch to another—and even replace the first card and switch back! Maximum session duration is 13 hours. (With current NLEs, spanned clips cannot be combined. Depending on NLE, audio may be discontinuous at the breaks.)
High-quality audio Two XLR connectors support professional microphones such as the Sony ECM-680S and wireless microphone systems such as the UWP-V1. Use the built-in stereo microphone or the use the external XLR inputs to record two channels of 24-bit 48kHz audio.
Time code input/output A true professional, the PXW-Z100 provides time code input and output, vital to multi-camera productions.
Wi-Fi remote control For operating flexibility, you can control record start/stop, focus, zoom and aperture from a smartphone browser.
Creative paint functions The PXW-Z100 affords exceptional creative control with adjustable gamma curve, black level, skin detail, color and more. You can even save these parameters to a memory card as a camera profile. Then use your profile on another PXW-Z100 for precise matching in multi-camera setups.
Powerful focus assist Because focus is especially critical on 4K content, Sony provides auto focus and one-touch auto focus, plus powerful support for manual focus, including color peaking and focus magnifier.
60Hz and 50Hz system switchable
Optional 3 or 5 year Extended Warranty available]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The Traveler Camera Case series is specifically designed for cameras with ENG-style viewfinders.  The Traveler has thick foam padding, reinforced by hollow-core plastic on the bottom and sides.  A layer of non-slip, water-proof material has been added to the interior and exterior bottom panels of the case.  The interior, along with the foam support block, stabilize the camera inside the case.  The exterior wipes clean easily and provides extra water-proof protection.

The armored plastic view finder protector provides extra support for fragile ENG-style viewfinders.  The zipper-facing extends over the zipper to keep rain and debris from getting inside the case during transport.  Six total pockets help you organize and protect batteries, tape stock, cables, filters, and your Portabrace Rain-Slicker. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 504HD is Manfrotto's latest video fluid head. It is a perfect balance of design and performance. The bridge design improves the head's rigidity and its PAN friction control is fast, simple to fine-tune and protected from knocks.
All structural components are made from aluminum, with the PAN axis rotation unit using ball bearings to obtain smooth, totally vibration-free controlled movements that can be directly adjusted using the head's FDS variable friction system. FDS on both the PAN and TILT axes also ensures that the head works perfectly at all temperatures, with all types of equipment and under all loads.
Ergonomically improved lever and dial designs combine with the new friction index to give you complete control over the 504HD.
The 504HD has been designed to offer a load capacity of up to 7.5kg (16.5lb) making it suitable for a huge range of camera equipment. The CBS counterbalance system has 4 presets for a full range of camera weights (0.2.5kg-5.5lb, 5kg-11lb and 7.5kg-16.5lb).
Leveling the head is easy thanks to the 75mm diameter hemisphere and the back-lit bubble level. Two 3/8” threads on the top plate allow accessories (such as monitors and arms) to be directly and securely attached to the head, which helps cut down set-up time, keeps your camera hot shoe free and, saves you from using another clamp.
High rigidity structure delivers maximum response and strength. Ergonomic controls for easy use in all conditions. Easy-link connections for accessories. 4-step counterbalance system ensures a quick set-up with optimal balance. Ball Bearing drag system for precise, smooth movements.
Lightweight modern materials for optimum balance of strength and weight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The MVM500A is a lightweight fluid monopod with a specially adapted 500 video head attached. It has an innovative fluid pan cartridge incorporated into the monopod base that gives you an incredibly smooth panning action. Great compactness while folded thanks to the three retractable feet.

The patented fluid monopod features wider platform for HDSLR bodies and the sliding plate travels to balance the latest interchangeable lens cameras. The fluid monopod ensures smooth shots and fine control with up to 5kg (11 lbs) of equipment.

Faster, easier and safer to use: the side lock system allows the camera and sliding QR plate to click quickly into the head from above, instead of needing to be aligned and slid in from the back. No secondary safety lock is necessary. The side lock system also makes it quicker and simpler to lift the camera out of the head from above.

The MVM500A has one Easy Link 3/8” connector to allow an external monitor or other accessory equipment to be fitted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Diva-Lite 201 is a soft light source ideally suited for Television or Film documentary shooting styles. The unit provides a broad, soft and diffused light. As a cosmetic light source the Diva-Lite 201 is ideal for news presenters reporting from locations around the world. It’s compact size and rugged lightweight nature make them well suited for travel. 

The Diva-Lite puts out a broad soft wash of light. The drop off is like the light off of a bounce card. 
For this reason it is most effective in close proximity to the subject. By being close, the light is softer and easily controlled with the built-in barndoors and detachable louvers.
This instrument is proving to be very popular for interviews. It is small enough to travel easily. It is light enough to rig onto lighting stands or onto grip arms. 
Diva-Lites operate on Kino Flo True Match 55W compact fluorescent lamps. Daylight balanced (KF55) and tungsten balanced (KF32) lamps are available. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The GLIDECAM X-10 is a highly advanced, professional Body-Mounted Camera Stabilization System designed to be used with specific Glidecam Hand-held Camera Stabilizers**. The GLIDECAM X-10 system will allow you to walk, run, go up and down stairs, shoot from moving vehicles and travel over uneven terrain without any camera instability or shake.
The GLIDECAM X-10 is very similar in design to the Glidecam Smooth Shooter; however the X-10 comes with both sections of its support arm being able to move vertically, whereas the Smooth Shooter comes with only the front section of its support arm being able to move vertically. Also, the X-10 comes with a trimmable Arm-to-Vest Connector, whereas the Smooth Shooter’s Arm-to-Vest Connector is not trimmable.
The GLIDECAM X-10 system works by isolating your body's motion from your camera, while your camera is balanced in a relatively motionless and isolated state. The GLIDECAM X-10'S Support Arm can be boomed up and down, as well as pivoted in and out, and side-to-side. It is the combined booming and pivoting action of the Support Arm that isolates your motions from the camera in a way that creates smooth camera footage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the Glidecam HD-Series hand-held Stabilizers your camcorder seems to float, always balanced, isolated from your hands undesirable motions. Now you are free to move with your camera - panning, tilting, booming or running without any camera instability or shake.
The Glidecam HD-Series works so well that it allows you to shoot incredibly smooth and graceful shots even while going to extremes like running up and down stairs or traveling over rugged terrain. And when it comes to normal shooting, like walking or moving the camera slowly around someone, the results are equally magical. 
Each HD-Series Stabilizer’s offset, foam cushioned, Handle Grip is attached to a free floating, three axis Gimbal.  This allows your hand to move up and down, and side-to-side, thereby isolating your hand’s unwanted motions from the camera. This up and down movement alleviates the bouncing, pogo type action often associated with our competitor’s system because their handle cannot move up and down.  This design feature, coupled with the overall higher inertia of the  HD-Series systems, produces superior stabilization when compared with our competition.
A unique and proprietary, precision, three-axis Gimbal incorporates several adjustable, axis convergence controls.  This allows all three axes to intersect for proper operational alignment.
A camera-mounting platform with a quick-release, no-tools, drop-on camera plate allows you to quickly attach or remove your camera.  Ergonomic, control knobs allow quick, precise adjustment of the top stage’s back and forth, and side-to-side movement.  These controls allow you to adjust the camera’s horizontal balance.

		<description><![CDATA[Bringing Canon's expertise and decades of experience designing sensors, lenses, image processing and design to the world of motion picture capture, the EOS C300 camera has been designed to meet the demanding needs of cinema industry professionals, providing a modular, portable and eminently adaptable system of cameras, lenses and accessories built for moviemaking in the 21st century. The EOS C300 camera with Dual Pixel AF technology features a CMOS sensor that consists of an array of pixels that each feature two separate photodiodes. By continuously comparing their outputs during AF mode, phase-difference autofocus helps ensure non-blurred images and smooth focus transitions even when the talent and/or camera are moving. The new feature places a high priority on maintaining sharp focus while, providing a natural, smooth focus transitions with select Canon autofocus EF lenses – including newer-generation STM lenses – which offer even smoother and quieter operation. The Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology helps provide smooth and consistent autofocus, so that focus transitions are natural looking and that subjects can remain focused even as they move. The compatibility of Dual Pixel CMOS AF with Canon EF autofocus lenses combines outstanding optical tools with a wide range of creative options.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Canon is proud to present the highly anticipated EOS 5D Mark III. With supercharged EOS performance and stunning full frame, high-resolution image capture, the EOS 5D Mark III is designed to perform. Special optical technologies like the 61-Point High Density Reticular AF and an extended ISO range of 100–25600 (expandable to 50 (L), 51200 (H1) and 102400 (H2) make the EOS 5D Mark III ideal for shooting weddings in the studio or out in the field, and great for still photography. Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes. Additional technological advancements include an Intelligent Viewfinder, Canon's advanced iFCL metering system, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Multiple Exposure mode-all of which help make the EOS 5D Mark III the perfect multimedia tool.  

In response to user requests, Canon has released a firmware update that expands the versatility and functionality of the EOS 5D Mark III. This update enables the camera to export clean, uncompressed HDMI output to an external recorder, while still being able to record to internal CF or SD cards and monitor the video on the rear LCD display. In addition, this update improves autofocus performance by allowing cross-type support at f/8 (center point)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM is a high performance, water-resistant, and ultra wide-angle Canon L-series lens. It has been specifically designed for improved edge-to-edge image quality that will meet the strict requirements of professional and high-end amateur photographers. It features 3 high-precision aspherical lens elements, each of a different type: ground, replica and GMo for even better image quality than the original EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM. The circular aperture produces a beautiful and natural background blur when shooting at wider apertures. Other features include internal focusing, a ring type USM (Ultra Sonic Motor), and new AF algorithms for fast and quiet autofocusing.

		<description><![CDATA[The HJ40x10B and the companion highly telephoto HJ40x14B represent the pinnacle of Canon portable high definition EFP lens design. 

These lenses are intended for producers and broadcasters engaged in documentary, natural history, and the many other challenging location productions that seek superb image capture over very considerable distances. These lenses embody superb built-in image stabilization systems that have become industry renowned. Aerial shooting, sports and entertainment coverage, portable acquisition in arduous terrain and under dynamic environmental situations (heavy winds) – are all superbly supported by these stalwart HD lenses. 

ABOUT THIS LENS
The HJ40x10B and the companion HJ40x14B are a high definition EFP lens family that brings entirely new shooting flexibilities to field production. The HJ40x10B can extend to 770mm with the extender while the HJ40x14B can achieve an unprecedented 1120mm. Both lenses represent the very best in optical and mechanical design and their unique optical image stabilization systems make possible the capture of rock steady high definition imagery under the most adverse of field conditions. 

They represent an excellent marriage of needs for creative flexibility and mobility in a handheld HDTV camera system with the demanding performance requirements for high-end HDTV image acquisition at long focal lengths. The design optimization strategies included a dual lens approach to broaden the shooting options, achievement of an adequate sensitivity, maximization of image contrast, and preservation of the highest MTF over the long focal ranges. 

High contrast is ensured by superb control of black reproduction – with optical and mechanical design innovations that substantially reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections. Similar attention to minimization of ghost images and other highlight-related chromatic distortions caused by strong light sources on-axis and off-axis further extend the operational contrast range of the lens.

]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Five significant technologies converge to produce the HJ40x10B and the HJ40x14B portable HD production lens system that has been tailored to partner with today's highest performing HDTV portable cameras and camcorders:

Newly developed optical materials combined with the very latest lens element design innovations and multilayer coatings - that produce an unsurpassed pristine imaging system for the most discerning production team. The e-HDxs logo identifies the deployment of these technologies in the lens.



Power Optics - speaks to the combination of specialized materials, contemporary optical design, and multilayer coatings that produce the superb imagery
Internal Focus - a Canon design innovation that uses a floating optical system to better control chromatic aberrations
Crossover Technology - switchable operation between 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratio imagery
Image Stabilization Technologies 
A built-in Optical Shift Image Stabilizer (identified by the Shift-IS logo) system that effectively removes image stabilities especially at the telephoto extremes of the lens
Digital Technologies 
New third-generation enhanced digital servo systems using Canon-developed 16-bit optical rotary encoder devices introduce entirely new value-added creativity to handheld acquisition systems

Enhanced Digital Drive technology - encompasses a microcomputer driven servo control that embodies position memory and user-defined digital functionality to significantly empower the camera operator charged with creative shaping of the image presented to the camera sensors
16-bit rotary encoder for aperture control reports to the associated camera Iris control system (10-bit compatibility)
Maximum Zoom speed is 0.5 seconds and Focus is 1.5 seconds
Mechanical Technologies 
ergonomic mechanical design that produced this HD lens having the same size and weight as its SDTV predecessor

Compact digital servo drive unit is mounted to the lens at a 12.5 degree angle for comfort and balance
Magnesium alloy body for light weight and exceptional durability
Ecological Design 
All contemporary Canon lenses avoid the use of materials and substances potentially harmful to the environment. Lead has been removed from all optics and other identified substances from all components comprising the composite lens system.

		<description><![CDATA[The HJ22ex7.6B is the longest focal length portable HDTV production lens offered by Canon (without an image stabilization system). It is a smaller and lighter replacement for the former highly popular HJ21ex7.8B lens. It is a strategic member of the family of HD portable EFP lenses – that collectively offers an unusually broad range of creative options.

This particular lens is intended for producers and broadcasters having as their foremost priority the ability to shoot over long distances combined with wide angle capture in a lightweight (4.0 lbs) mobile production lens system having exceptional HDTV performance. The optional flexibility of Canon’s Crossover aspect ratio switching system makes it a superb performer for both 16:9 widescreen and standard 4:3 image formats.

ABOUT THIS LENS

The HJ22ex7.6B mobilized the best in portable EFP optical design criteria to achieve a remarkable lens offering focal lengths up to 168mm (or 336mm with extender) and a wide-angle of 64.6 degrees horizontal (for the 16:9 aspect ratio). Combined with an exceptionally high sensitivity (F1.8 maximum aperture) this is a lens that can encompass an unusually broad range of shooting situations.

The design optimization strategies sought a high and balanced MTF profile over the entire image plane at an approximate F4.0 aperture setting that is well-maintained even when the lens aperture is wide open. Relative light distribution was optimized for F2.8 and above and this uniformity of brightness across the image plane combines with the high contrast and excellent picture sharpness to produce vividly clear HD pictures. Contrast was extended by superb control of black reproduction – with optical and mechanical design innovations that substantially reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections. Similar attention to minimization of ghost images and other highlight-related chromatic distortions caused by strong light sources on-axis and off-axis further extend the operational contrast range of the lens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The KJ17ex7.7B is the first of a new family of second generation 2/3-inch HDgc portable HD lenses. The new design reflects design refinements to the first generation line of HDgc lenses originally introduced in 2006.

The HDgc line of lenses had been specifically developed to achieve a price performance ratio that was commensurate with the new line of cost-effective HD camcorders being introduced by all major camera manufacturers in response to the broadcast industry’s rapidly growing interest in transitioning to HDTV newsgathering, HD reality shows, and other lower-budget HD productions. They also directly address the increasing adoption of HD digital origination by the growing independent filmmaking market sector.  In addition, they are anticipated to foster growing interest in HD within the broad B2B market sectors. To support this extensive flexibility in HD acquisition systems, the HDgc family includes 2/3-inch, 1/2-inch, and 1/3-inch lenses.

The KJ17ex7.7B is a portable HDTV production lens within the 2/3-inch image format sector of the new HDgc family. This particular lens is intended for users whose foremost priority is an affordable HD lens that delivers a generous range of focal lengths combined with a wide field of view in a lightweight mobile package. It was specifically designed for the many new cost-effective but remarkably high-performance 2/3-inch acquisition systems that appeared in 2008-2009.

In the KJ17ex7.7B lens imaging performance has been significantly advanced by mobilizing the most contemporary of optical glasses, optical coating materials and processes, and powerful new optical design tools.  Customer feedback also spurred a total redesign of the digital drive unit that further optimized both the ergonomic aspects and the performance of the digital electronic control of zoom, iris, and focus.

The short 7.7 mm focal length translates to a 63.9 degree horizontal angle of view for the 16:9 HD image format.  Combined with a focal range that has been extended to now cover a range from 7.7mm to 131mm (and 262mm with extender) this lens offers unsurpassed operational capabilities in a compact package weighing less than 3.5lbs. Focus breathing has also been significantly reduced over the predecessor lens.  

ABOUT THIS LENS
The KJ17ex7.7B represents a new degree of optimization in meeting the demands for mobility in a handheld HDTV camera system and achieving the imaging quality sought in HDTV broadcast news acquisition while also essentially maintaining the price level of the original HDgc.  The maximum relative aperture is F1.9 which, combined with the typically F-10/11 sensitivity specifications of the contemporary HD ENG cameras, ensures excellent video pictures in very low light environments.  The image performance strategies of this new lens sought a tighter control of MTF across the entire image plane and with operational variations of zoom, iris, and focus.  Minimization of monochromatic and chromatic aberrations and further maximization of image contrast combine with the improved MTF to produce superb picture sharpness. 

Relative light distribution over the mid to long focal lengths is better controlled and this better uniformity of brightness across the image plane combines with the higher contrast and higher MTF to produce sharp clear HD pictures.  Contrast was enhanced by excellent control of black reproduction using new multilayer anti-reflective optical coatings and new optomechanical design innovations that significantly reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections.
  
The lens spectral transmittance characteristic was closely coordinated with that of all of the major portable HD cameras to ensure adherence to the international HDTV colorimetric standard.

		<features><![CDATA[Four significant technologies converged to produce the KJ17ex7.7B portable HD ENG lens system that has been designed to partner with the most contemporary of the new tapeless 2/3-inch HD production cameras: 
Optical Technologies 
Newly developed optical glass materials each having unique dispersion characteristics allowed improved control over chromatic aberrations and geometric distortion. Lens element surface accuracy has been improved two-fold over those in the earlier HDgc lenses contributing to the improved MTF performance
New Multilayer Optical Coatings combined with new deposition processes produce an improved optical contrast ratio
Three-part Internal Focus is a Canon design innovation that reduces changes in aberrations when focusing to different object distances while also exercising improved control over any tendency for focus breathing
New and more powerful computer design tools facilitated a greater degree of optimization of multiple optical variables in the lens design
Digital Technologies 
new fourth-generation digital servo systems further empowers the camera operator in terms of operational creativity:

Enhanced Digital Drive technology based upon a totally new software platform provides precision microcomputer control of the three servo systems for zoom, iris and focus while also facilitating new developments in lens-camera correction of lateral chromatic aberration
Unique Information Display and extended memory within the digital drive unit extends user-defined digital functionality 

Canon's patented Micro Roofmirror Array (MRA) technology underlies the unique miniature 16-bit rotary encoders that are used for each of the zoom, iris, and focus position detection (each with a positional accuracy of 0.1 micrometer)
Dynamic Zoom Speed Range can be adjusted from 0.5 seconds to 5 minutes (from wide to telephoto extremes)
Optomechanical Technologies 
extensive use of 3D CAD-CAM design facilitated a design that paid high attention to operator comfort and attendant lowering of fatigue during protracted shooting: 

Digital Drive Unit was totally redesigned to take into account the curved human hand that encompasses the unit with a view of shaping the unit for greater comfort and to better facilitate the actuation of lens controls. The unit shape also provides a wider separation that allows the other hand to more easily adjust the focus control. Finally, the drive unit was narrowed and its mounting angle on the lens set to allow the operator's elbow to settle close to the body thus providing an important reduction in fatigue when operating a shoulder mounted lens-camera system 
Special Magnesium alloy body for light weight and exceptional durability
Computer simulation of the optomechanical design allowed examination of optimized anti-reflection internal barrel coatings, and structural techniques (light blocking grooves and knife edges) that produced greater control over harmful light reflections within the lens barrel that can be stimulated by strong light sources
Ecological Design 
All contemporary Canon lenses avoid the use of materials and substances potentially harmful to the environment. Lead has been removed from all optics and other identified substances from all components comprising the composite lens system.]]></features>

HD to SD downscaling - Proper conversion of the HD color space to the SD color space and proper aspect ratio conversion to anamorphic, letterbox, and center cut are provided. You can monitor or record an SD master of an HD project in real time.
SD to HD upscaling - Proper conversion of the SD color space to the HD color space is performed. Footage with a 4:3 aspect ratio will be "pillarboxed". SD 16:9 footage will be scaled to full screen.
Cross conversions from 720 to 1080 and 1080 to 720
All scaling operations can be accompanied by frame rate conversion with 2:3:2:3 and 2:3:3:2 cadences to facilitate monitoring 23.98 fps footage on a monitor that does not support the specific frame rate.

		<description><![CDATA[Small and simple to use, T-TAP connects direct to your Mac or Windows system via the blazing-fast Thunderbolt connection which provides the bandwidth necessary for full broadcast-quality video and audio output. Based on the same architecture as AJA’s KONA cards, T-TAP offers full 10-bit broadcast-quality output, superior to DisplayPort adapters that only support 8-bit and are not true video output solutions for professional applications. SD/HD SDI and HDMI outputs are available, with support for 3D HDMI output. The SDI output can be used to feed professional monitors or recording gear, while the HDMI output is able to feed directly into consumer HDMI monitors. Both HDMI and SDI are active at all times, so you can simultaneously work with professional and consumer gear. 3D support enables T-TAP to output directly to 3D HDMI monitors for real time stereoscopic review, with no need for additional hardware. Even with its small size, T-TAP doesn’t compromise on professional audio functionality. Full 8-channel embedded audio allows for multi-channel playback such as 5.1 - or even 7.1 mixes. T-TAP is powered via Thunderbolt with no need for an additional power supply, minimizing cabling and maximizing portability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Offering huge flexibility and the power to adapt to meet the needs of rapidly changing environments, FS2 offers unprecedented conversion and frame synchronization power in a 1RU space. Capable of simultaneously working with two independent streams of 3G/HD/SD 10-bit broadcast-quality video and two independent groups of multi-channel analog or digital audio, each FS2 video channel supports virtually any input or output: analog component or composite, 3G/HD/SD-SDI, Dual Link (1.485 Gb), Fiber and HDMI I/O. A Fiber I/O option allows fiber cable runs of up to 10 kilometers to be connected directly to the FS2 without the need for separate fiber to SDI conversion. Each video processing channel can be individually cropped and resized using AJA’s image scaling technology for the best possible
quality when incorporating non-standard image sizes. FS2 can be used as two separate Frame Synchronizers/Format Converters, or the two channels can be linked with the internal FS2 keyer to do the work of three or more devices - for example HD sidebar keying where both the video and background graphics are up converted and combined. FS2 can up or down convert between SD, HD, and 3G HD (1080p50/60), and cross convert between HD formats including 3G HD. Additionally, FS2 has full input and output signal routing, allowing any I/O port to be assigned to either processing channel.
For audio, FS2 has two audio processors, each supporting 16-channel AES/EBU digital audio, 16-channel embedded audio, and 8-channel balanced analog audio with a variety of controls for maximum flexibility. The output of each processor can be embedded in its respective video processor output (SDI, Fiber, or HDMI), or sent to the AES or balanced outputs. For 3G and Dual Link inputs, the audio processors can have access to all 32 channels. FS2 supports closed captioning and the conversion of closed captioning between SD and HD formats - including full conversion between CEA-608 and CEA-708 caption standards. ]]></description>

Notes:
1. In the case of 1080pSF/23.98 input - and when 1080i59.94 (or 525) is selected as an output format, the FS2 automatically does 3:2 pulldown to get the correct frame rate. Similarly, in the case of 1080pSF/24 input, FS2 automatically does 3:2 pulldown to get the correct frame rate.
2. When passing 24 or 60 framerate video, output is high definition.

		<features><![CDATA[Newly developed three 1/2"-type Exmor™ CMOS Full HD sensors	The PXW-X200 incorporates three 1/2"-type Full-HD Exmor CMOS sensors to achieve high resolution, high sensitivity, low noise, and wide dynamic range. With these image sensors, the PXW-X200 achieves a high sensitivity of F12 at 1080/59.94i and F13 at 1080/50i - essential levels for professionals shooting under challenging lighting conditions.
17x optical zoom lens with three independent rings with end-stops	The PXW-X200 is equipped with a 17x optical zoom lens able to zoom from 29.3mm to 499mm (35mm equivalent). It has three independent control rings with end-stops, which allows manual control of focus, zoom and iris, making for better and faster adjustment. The 8 pin lens remote connector is located on the lens grip, which enables to use third party controlers such as Libec, VariZoom, and Bebbob.
High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Log GOP recordings	The PXW-X200 supports not only MPEG HD422 50Mbps in MXF (Material eXchange Format), which is widely accepted by major broadcasters worldwide, but also XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP codecs. XAVC technology is based on the H.264 standard, which provides an exceptional performance compression technology. XAVC Intra (frame) compression means that every frame is encoded independent of the other frames - providing a better quality picture, without compromises. With a Long GOP codec, only certain frames are encoded individually. This allows the codec to squeeze the video into a much smaller bitrate than Intra technology. The main benefit is faster ingest and editing. XAVC Long GOP files also require less storage space than XAVC Intra files, providing budget savings on recording media. The XAVC codec adopts 4:2:2 10-bit sampling for high definition recording with rich grading expression.
Dual SxS media slots for Simultaneous*/Relay recording	The PXW-X200 is equipped with two SxS memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with SxS PRO+, SxS-1 memory cards, and also SDXC** and SDHC** cards can be used with the adapter MEAD-SD02, and XQD** card with QDA-EX1. Two media slots can record in either "Simultaneous" or "Relay" mode. "Simultaneous" mode* permits recording the same content to two memory cards at the same time, while "Relay" mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. 

* "Simultaneous" recording mode requires free future firmware upgrade. 
** Some selected recording mode and salvage feature are not supported.
Wireless file transfer and live streaming from the field*	Users can simply attach the supplied Wireless LAN module to activate the wireless function on the PXW-X200. And by connecting with separately sold internet routers, proxy or high-resolution files can be transferred to a cloud server, and the editing process can be started while location shooting continues. The PXW-X200 also has a streaming capability. By attaching a separately sold LTE USB module*, live video and audio can be streamed, watched, and recorded at a remote location. 

* A free future firmware version upgrade is required to activate this function.
Near Field Communication* (NFC) function with Content Browser Mobile	A Near Field Communication (NFC) function allows easy, one-touch wireless LAN connection to a smartphone or tablet device without manual setting of the network parameters. A Content Browser Mobile** application enables users to monitor the currently shot video and to wirelessly control camcorder settings such as focus, zoom, iris, white balance, REC START/STOP, and more. 

* NFC allows close-range wireless communication between the PXW-X200 and an NFC-equipped smartphone or tablet device. 
** This application can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store.
Proxy recording on SD card	The PXW-X200 can record proxy video H.264 on an SD card. The resolution and bitrate of proxy video can be changed for a more flexible workflow. The proxy files are recorded in MP4 format for better compatibility with broadcast systems. The lightweight proxy video files are generated separately from the main line recording and recorded to SD cards for quick sharing of content over low-bandwidth mobile networks. 

Video: AVC/H.264 Main Profile, 4:2:0, MP4 
Audio: AAC-LC, 2ch, 48KHz, 128kbps
Wide choice of connections	The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including single 3G HD-SDI, HDMI, USB, composite output, timecode input/output and genlock input. The 3G HD-SDI connector is able to output the 1080/59.94P or 50P signal. Down-conversion output from HD to SD is also possible. The i.LINK connector can be used for HDV when SP 1440 (FAT) mode is selected and for DV when DVCAM (FAT) mode is selected. Simultaneous output from both SDI and HDMI is possible. The Rec Trigger signal can be sent through SDI and HDMI to link an external recording device.
Multi Interface Shoe* (MI Shoe) for flexible connection	The PXW-X200 is equipped with a Multi Interface Shoe (MI Shoe) that has an electric interface in its mechanical attachment allowing the camcorder to communicate with an attached accessory. Accessories attached to the MI Shoe can be controlled by the camcorder. Using an MI Shoe connection with sold separate optional adapter SMAD-P3, the audio signal from a UWP-D series wireless microphone package can be input from the wireless microphone receiver to the PXW-X200 without an XLR cable. The power can be supplied from the PXW-X200 to the receiver and a battery is not required for the receiver operation. When the battery is attached to the LED video light HVL-LBPC, the light can be switched on and off from the camcorder which syncs with recording trigger. 

* A free future firmware version upgrade is required to activate hot shoe function.
Timecode and Genlock	The PXW-X200 is equipped with timecode input/output (selectable) and genlock input interfaces. These interfaces are useful when shooting with multiple camcorders. The video signal timing and the timecode can be synchronized among the camcorders, and this helps when assembling video clips from multiple camcorders in the editing process.
Catalyst "Browse" software from Sony	The new software Catalyst “Browse” is a free clip management tool for both PC & Mac that supports Sony professional formats. Review footage on location, add metadata and review color corrections. Paid upgrade option is available to the advanced Catalyst "Prepare" media preparation tool. Detail information can be found from the following link, and will guide you to download the available software.

		<description><![CDATA[The PXW-X70 features a 1.0" type Exmor™ R CMOS Sensor with a resolution of 20 megapixels. The sensor, which is even larger than the Super 16mm film frame, delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. 

The new camcorder has the ability to record High Definition in XAVC Long GOP, enabling 422 10-bit sampling at 50 Mbps. This in-turn supports a broadcast-quality workflow, increasingly adopted by productions in many different professional applications. A fixed ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens achieves 12x optical zoom which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom and doubled again to 48x with Digital Extender zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions. 

Advanced features include Wi-Fi/NFC (Near Field Communication) with Content Browser Mobile™ version 1.4 or later, plus dual media slots, simultaneous or relay recording, and independent record control. In addition, other wireless network features (e.g. live streaming, file transfer, etc.) are planned to be supported by a future upgrade and 4K recording functionality by charged base future upgrade, which are scheduled to be announced later.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[1.0" type Exmor R CMOS sensor for a wide range of shooting conditions	The PXW-X70 incorporates a 1.0" type Exmor R CMOS sensor to achieve high resolution, high sensitivity, low noise, and wide dynamic range. The sensor has 14.2 million effective pixels enhancing shooting under severe lighting conditions and providing more freedom of creative expression.
High sensitivity and high resolution	Thanks to the 1.0" type Exmor R CMOS sensor, the PXW-X70 has high sensitivity 1.67 stops brighter than a 1/2.88" type sensor. The camcorder also has higher resolution than any other camcorder in its price range. The 1.0" type sensor is brighter and offers more background defocus with a shallow depth of field than 1/3" type or 1/4.7" type sensors.
Compact body	The palm-sized PXW-X70 is ergonomically designed to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use experience.
ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens with lens ring	The PXW-X70 is supplied with a fixed 29 mm wide-angle ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens. Ideal for capturing grand landscapes, it also provides up to 12x optical zoom. It also has one lens ring which enables smooth, natural adjustment of focusing or zooming, depending on which mode is selected.
Clear Image Zoom	The 12x optical zoom can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom, maintaining full resolution using Super Resolution Technology. In addition, the Digital Extender can double this range again, up to 48x zoom. Super Resolution Technology is a Sony original intelligent interpolation which analyzes the input image and increases the resolution of the image.
Manual controls	The manual dial and buttons on the side of the body allow swift and easy adjustment of IRIS (aperture), GAIN/ISO and shutter speed.
ND filter control mechanism	The PXW-X70 is equipped with multipule ND Filter selections, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions from 1/4ND, 1/16 to 1/64ND.
Wi-Fi/NFC (Near Field Communication) with Content Browser Mobile, and Video/Audio Streaming for future upgrade	The PXW-X70 can be remotely controlled from a smartphone or tablet computer (iOS 4.3 through 7.0 or Android 2.3 through 4.3) via a Wi-Fi connection, and recorded video files can be transferred from camcorder to smartphone in MP4 format.* In addition to file transfer, streaming via 4G/LTE is planned to be available by firmware upgrade in the future. One-touch authentication is also possible with smartphones that offer NFC connectivity. The required Content Browser Mobile mobile smartphone application can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store. 

* Wi-Fi operation is not be guaranteed with all smartphones and tablet computers.
Multi-format recording and 4K ready	The PXW-X70 records XAVC Long GOP 422 10-bit 1920x1080 60p/50p/60i/50i/30p/25p/24p at 50 Mbps and 35 Mbps, 1920x1080 60i/50i at 25 Mbps, as well as 1280x720 60p/50p at 50 Mbps. It is also possible to record AVCHD 420 8-bit at 1920x 1080 and 1280x720 and DV. The PXW-X70 is also 4K ready and can handle 4K recordings with a future upgrade.
Dual media slots for simultaneous/relay recording, and independent record control	The PXW-X70 is equipped with two memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with Memory Stick PRO Duo (Mark 2), Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and Memory Stick XC-HG Duo media*, as well as SDXC* and SDHC cards. Two media slots can record in either simultaneous or relay mode. Simultaneous mode permits simultaneous recording to two memory cards, while relay mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. The user can set up the two Start/Stop buttons on the PXW-X70, one on the grip and one on the camcorder body, to independently start and stop recording on different memory cards while recording in simultaneous mode. 

* XAVC can be recorded on either SDXC or Memory Stick XC cards due to high bit rate.
Slow & Quick Motion	Smooth slow or quick motion with full HD quality is available without any extra processing. 2.5x slow motion can be easily achieved by setting the recording format to 24p and the capturing frame rate to 60 fps. The frame rate can also be set to 1 fps for 60x quick motion. In order to go into the S&Q Motion mode, the camera needs to be in XAVC & AVCHD mode (Not DV mode) and Manual mode.
Picture Profile	You can fine-tune the look of movies before shooting by adjusting gradation (black level, gamma and black gamma), adjustment (mode, intensity, tone and depth), basic (gamma and mode) and more. Adjusted parameters can be saved along with other settings as a profile, and up to seven profiles can be stored for later recall.
99 Camera Profiles	It is possible to save up to 99 camera settings under different profile numbers. User can copy the settings from one PXW-X70 to another PXW-X70 so that user can shoot with multiple cameras in the same settings (only works with same model camcorders). Also, users can save camera settings for each scene, so that it is possible to recall proper settings for the scene immediately..
Multi Interface Shoe (MI Shoe) for flexible connection	The MI Shoe* on top of the PXW-X70 camera body has several possibilities to be used to attach the supplied handle, which will allow Rec Start/Stop, Zoom & Audio Control. Using the MI Shoe connection and the optional adapter SMAD-P3, the audio signal from a UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 wireless microphone package can be input from the wireless microphone receiver to the PXW-X70 without an XLR cable. The power can be supplied from the PXW-X70 to the receiver and a battery is not required for the receiver operation. 

* It is not recommended to use the HVL-LBPC light with the MI Shoe as the battery requirement is too high. When the supplied handle is attached to the MI Shoe, it is not possible to use the MI Shoe to control the UWP-D receiver.
Viewfinder includes amazing OLED technology	This 0.39” type OLED viewfinder offers superb OLED brightness, contrast and response. The high resolution (1,440K dot) of the viewfinder allows better precision of manual focus operations and eliminates any color-breaking phenomenon.
Wide choice of connections	The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including 3G HD-SDI, standard size HDMI connector, USB and composite output. Both TC and Rec Trigger signal can be sent through SDI and HDMI to link an external recording device. 

* SDI / HDMI / Composite can not be used at the same time.]]></features>

Ergonomic grip design and adjustable arm and Viewfinder system
The PXW-FS7 grip, designed for easy handling and operability, is the result of exhaustive consultation with videographers and cinematographers, as well as the production of various prototypes. The shape supports long periods of camera use and flexibly accommodates subtle differences among various users' gripping styles. The angle of the grip can be easily adjusted with the press of a button. In addition to a zoom button and Rec Start/Stop, the grip also has several programmable buttons that can be customized for easy access to any other functions such as the expanded focus function. The length of the arm section of the PXW-FS7 can be adjusted just by turning a knob. Another knob at the joint makes it easy to adjust the angle of the camera. So a user can choose a comfortable style that suits his or her physique and shooting position.
Easy settings during one-man operation
The Peaking and Zebra function buttons and contrast knob are positioned on the side of the PXW-FS7 viewfinder for easy adjustment of focus, contrast and exposure. Also, by turning a single knob, the position of the finder can be set, allowing for degrees of freedom. The viewfinder system is designed that even people with a dominant left eye can use it comfortably.
Dust-proof, drip-proof design for use even in harsh environments
The body of the PXW-FS7 is constructed to withstand tough conditions, with buttons, dials and other parts specially sealed to prevent dust and water spray from entering. Also, the air passageways from the cooling fan are separated from the interior of the camera.
Built-in Multi-Interface (MI) Shoe
The PXW-FS7 is equipped with a Multi-Interface (MI) Shoe that supports connection to wireless microphone packages such as the UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 (sold separately). When connected to the shoe, the HVL-LBPC light (optional) can be turned on or off from the camera, and power and audio connections are provided to the UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 without cables.
Equipped with high-sensitivity 4K Super 35mm Exmor CMOS sensor
The PXW-FS7 is equipped with a Super 35mm CMOS image sensor with approximately 11.6 million total pixels (4352 x 2662) and 8.9 million effective pixels. The high image readout speed of the image sensor allows the PXW-FS7 to support 4K motion-picture shooting and Super Slow Motion. The sensor also realizes a high sensitivity of ISO2000 and a wide dynamic range of 14 stops. Thanks to its full-pixel readout capability without pixel binning and sophisticated camera processing, jaggies and moire. are minimized.
Internal recording in 4K resolution up to 60fps
The PXW-FS7 supports internal recording at 4K resolution as well as a wide range of frame rates (59.94P, 50P, 29.97P, 25P and 23.98P). When viewed on a 4K monitor, footage shot in 4K is reproduced so clearly down to the finest details that it gives a viewer the illusion of actually being within the scene. When viewed on a Full HD monitor, 4K footage boasts even higher resolution than footage shot in Full HD.
Super Slow Motion continuous recording is possible
The PXW-FS7 offers continuous recording at Full HD image quality and a frame rate of up to 180 fps. This makes it possible to attain up to 7.5x Super Slow Motion when played back at 23.98 fps. Furthermore, support for unlimited shooting at Super Slow Motion means no more mistimed shots leading to extra takes. It also lets you pick out footage at exactly the point that you want.
α Mount System for a wide selection of lenses and E-mount that is suitable for movie shooting
The PXW-FS7 incorporates the α Mount System, with an E-mount lens mount. This is especially useful for motion-picture shooting because the system supports power driven silent auto focus, iris control, power zoom and more, as well as SteadyShot image stabilization and other functions. Moreover, the E-mount system's short flange-back distance (the distance from the lens-mounting surface to the image sensor) enables use of A-mount lenses via LA-EA4 lens adaptor, as well as various other lenses via third-party adaptors. The E-mount system thereby makes it possible to take advantage of a wealth of lens resources suitable for creative, versatile video expression.
Supports various formats, including XAVC Intra and Long GOP
The PXW-FS7 supports two formats, XAVC and MPEG-2 HD 422, which can be selected to suit the application. Two XAVC compression systems (Intra and Long GOP) are provided through an H.264AVC codec. Intra supports recording with 4:2:2 10-bit sampling for 4K and Full HD, as well as a high bit rate of up to 600 Mbps. In Long GOP, image quality and recording time are balanced to allow Full HD recording in 1080/50P with 4:2:2 10-bit sampling at only 50 Mbps, making this format suitable for longer duration shooting. Support is also provided for the MPEG2 HD 422 recording format, which is mainly used at broadcast stations. Supported formats and bit rates are indicated below.
Support for S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3, SGamut3/S-Log3 and other log curves
The PXW-FS7 supports such log gamma curves as S-Gamut3. Cine/S-Log3 and S-Gamut3/S-Log3. Due to the fact that 18% grey is set at a bright level, S-Log3 is noted for delivering a wider dynamic range than the 1300% achieved by S-log2 incorporated in cameras such as the NEX-FS700, a difference equal to 1.5 stops. The log gamma itself is close to Cineon log, so colour correction is easier to perform and it is possible to achieve cinematic expression with the look of film. In addition, compared to the colour gamut of S-Gamut3. Cine, which is geared toward reproducing the wide colour gamut of DCI-P3 colour space used in digital cinema, the colour gamut of S-Gamut3 is geared toward the reproduction of almost all actual colours, and is thereby suitable for archival purposes.
Extension Unit XDCA-FS7 for shooting support
Extension Unit XDCA-FS7 can be connected directly to the PXW-FS7K to enable the use of functions that support the operator's shooting style or workflow, including Apple ProRes 422 recording to an XQD card in the camera.
Built-in ND filter unit
ND filters for adjusting the amount of light are provided in a built-in ND filter unit. This allows shooting to be done with a shallow depth of field without having to stop down the iris, even under bright conditions. The settings are Clear, 1/4 (2eV), 1/16 (4eV) and 1/64 (6eV).
Two XQD media slots support simultaneous and relay recording
The PXW-FS7 has two XQD card slots that enable simultaneous and relay recording. During relay recording, when one medium becomes full, recording continues automatically to the other media. During simultaneous recording, not only can the same footage be recorded on both channels at the same time, but also one channel can be used for random shooting while the other is being used for continuous recording as backup.
RAW output for external 4K/2K RAW recording*
The FXW-FS7’s FS RAW Interface that can be connected to an HXR-IFR5 interface unit and RAW AXS-R5 recorder to enable external 4K/2K RAW recording. The interface also allows the use of compatible third-party external recorders. Full HD footage shot with the unit is time code-synchronized to allow offline editing of the content.

* Requires XDCA-FS7 Extension Unit.
Support for multi-camera shooting*
Precise timecode synchronization provided by Genlock and Timecode In/Out functions in the XDCA-FS7 Extension Unit enable multi-camera operations.

* Requires XDCA-FS7 Extension Unit.

		<description><![CDATA[Presenting the α7S, the world’s smallest1 full frame interchangeable lens camera. Images and video come alive with a breakthrough 15.3 stops of dynamic range. ISO sensitivity up to 409,600 reveals astonishing detail and color even in the dead of night. Video excels with Full Pixel Readout, a 4K-optimized sensor and uncompressed 4K output via HDMI.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[35mm sensor w/ large pixels for high-ISO & Dynamic Range	The innovative α7S features a 12.2 effective megapixel 35mm Exmor® CMOS sensor paired with a powerful BIONZ X image processor, allowing it to shoot at a sensitivity range of ISO 50 – 4096004 with unprecedented dynamic range and low noise. The extra-large pixels on the α7S collects dramatically more light than traditional cameras to produce beautifully detailed, low-noise images in even the most challenging lighting environments.
12.2MP sensor optimized for 4k and low light video	The α7S is the world’s first 35mm camera to incorporate ‘direct pixel readout’ utilizing the entire width of the full-frame image sensor without line skipping or pixel binning. Therefore in both HD and 4K video acquisition I can read and process data from every one of the sensor’s pixels. This allows video shooters to utilize all of the artistic and creative benefits provided by the unique sensor.
Fast Intelligent AF in light as low as EV -4	Equipped with the same high-precision Fast Intelligent AF system as the α7R camera, the α7S drastically improve AF sensitivity in low-light that can go as low as -4EV.
New-generation RGB filter with gapless on-chip lens design	The larger than normal pixel size on the 35mm full-frame image sensor with effective 12.2MP, employs Sony’s latest image sensor technologies on the α7S. To boost the image sensor’s light collection efficiency, a new-generation RGB color filter has been adopted, in addition to the gapless on-chip lens design, light concentration technology and photodiode expansion technology delivers unprecedented high sensitivity and low-noise levels with high dynamic range in every light condition from severe low light to bright sunlight. By applying an AR coating on the surface of the seal glass over the image sensor, ghosting and flare　have been minimized, further contributing to the α7S’s high image quality.
Uncompressed 4:2:2 Full HD and 4K QFHD output via HDMI1	In video mode, the α7S can output 4K video at QFHD (3840x2160) in 4:2:2 to an optional external 3rd party 4K recorder via the HDMI1
50Mbps XAVC S 1920x1080 at 60P, 1280x720 at 120P	For the first time ever in a Sony α camera, the α7S adopts the workflow-friendly XAVC S recording format in addition to AVCHD and MP4 codecs. XAVC S format allows for full HD recording at a data rate of 50 mbps with lower compression for improved video quality. The α7S can record full HD (1920x1080) at frame rates of 60p, 60i, 30p and 24p directly to a compatible memory card. Video modes can be changed from full-frame to APS-C (super 35mm equivalent) if desired, and in this crop mode, the camera can support high frame rate 120fps shooting at standard HD resolution (1280 x 720p), creating a 5x slow-motion effect.
Pro-workflow w/ Picture Profile, S-Log2 and time code	The α7S is equipped with S-Log2 gamma. Common to Sony’s range of professional video cameras, S-Log2 expands the dynamic range by up to 1300% to minimize clipped highlights and loss of detail in shadows. The α7S include a picture profile that can adjust settings like gamma, black, level and color adjustment, and can be saved for use in a multi-camera shoot. It also has Full HD and 4K base band HDMI® output, time code/user bit for easier editing, synchronous recording feature with compatible devices, various marker and zebra displays on both the LCD screen and viewfinder.
High contrast 2.4-million dot XGA OLED Tru-Finder™ EVF	View every scene in rich detail with the XGA OLED Tru-Finder, which features OLED improvements and the same 3-lens optical system used in the flagship α99. The viewfinder faithfully displays what will appear in your recording, including the effects of your camera settings, so you can accurately monitor the results. You’ll enjoy rich tonal gradations and 3 times the contrast of the α99. High-end features like 100% frame coverage and a wide viewing angle are also provided.
3.0" 1.23M dot LCD tilts for high and low angle framing	The tiltable 3.0” (1,229k dots) Xtra Fine™ LCD Display makes it easy to photograph over crowds or low to capture pets eye to eye by swinging up approx. 84° and down approx. 45°. Easily scroll through menus and preview life thanks to WhiteMagic™ technology that dramatically increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.
Audio level controls, AAC/Linear PCM2, optional XLR kit	The α7S has a Multi-terminal interface shoe that is compatible with Sony’s XLR Adaptor Microphone Kits (XLR-K1M plus a new model under development), allowing the use of professional microphone systems.
Compatible w/ Sony E-mount lenses and many others3	Directly compatible with the growing family of E-mount lenses, the α7S camera can also be used with A-mount and others lens systems with optional adapters. Sony’s complete α lens system includes several premium offerings from Carl Zeiss® and G Series Lenses. Sony’s E-mount lens system is particularly well-suited for video shooting, with a variety of models containing “movie-friendly” features like smooth focusing, powered zoom control, and silent iris/aperture control.
Simple connectivity to smartphones via Wi-Fi® or NFC	Connectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi®/NFC control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, α7S also supports NFC (near field communication) providing “one touch connection” convenience when transferring images to Android™ smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control — a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone — connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.
Silent shutter mode for discreet shooting	Silent shutter mode is ideal when discretionary shooting is required; like capturing a recital or wildlife. Activating the silent shutter eliminates the use of the mechanical shutter and therefore shutter noise by utilizing an electronic shutter in its place.
PlayMemories™ Camera Apps allows feature upgrades	Personalize your camera by adding new features of your choice with PlayMemories™ Camera Apps. Find apps to fit your shooting style from portraits, detailed close-ups, sports, time lapse, motion shot and much more. Use apps that shoot, share and save photos using Wi-Fi® that make it easy to control and view your camera from smartphone, and post photos directly to Facebook or backup images to the cloud without connecting to a computer.11]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon EOS C100 Mark II Digital HD Camera offers all of the advantages of its predecessor while adding advanced new imaging and operational features by popular demand. Optimized for one-person use and compatible with the full range of Canon EF, EF-S, and EF-mount CN-E Cinema lenses, this greatly evolved camera integrates the same Emmy®-Award winning Canon Super 35mm CMOS Sensor used in all of Canon's Cinema EOS cameras, but now replaces the Canon DIGIC DV III Image Processor with the more sophisticated Canon DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor. In addition to improved RGB video processing, the camera's dual codec capability supports simultaneous AVCHD and MP4 recording, including 59.94P capture along with slow and fast motion recording. Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Face AF, wireless FTP video transfer, a built-in Canon Log LUT, GPS support and support for an extensive range of workflows, are additional operational features that have been added. A re-designed 270-degree rotating 3.5-inch OLED panel, and a tiltable large-size EVF with large-size eyecup, further empower the camera operator.

The compact, redesigned, lightweight body of the Canon EOS C100 Mark II Digital HD Camera has also evolved, and now includes a built-in microphone, START/STOP buttons clearly labeled in red, transparent covers on its twin SD card slots, improved battery insertion and removal, and an increased number of assignable buttons. Add to this its built-in ND filters, removable rotating pistol grip, removable top handle with twin XLR inputs, built-in stereo mic, and audio controls, and the Canon EOS C100 Mark II emerges as a powerfully evolved Super 35mm Digital HD camera designed to serve your quest for greater freedom of creative expression in HD video production.

		<description><![CDATA[Designed using the latest proprietary optical simulation software, the PL 14-35 mm wide angle lens offers exceptional optical performance in the center of the image and in the corners of the frame. The digital servo’s 16-bit encoding assures operators that all lens data output—including the position of the zoom, iris, and focus—is extremely accurate. The PL 14-35mm lens supports Lens Data System (LDS) and /i metadata formats, and can be controlled using cinema industry standard wireless controllers as well as existing FUJINON wired and wireless units.
The PL 14-35mm Cabrio lens has a detachable digital servo drive. The Cabrio can be used as a self-contained ENG-style lens or cine style lens. Cinematographers will also be right at home with this lens. With the detachable drive removed, the lens is set to accept industry standard cine motors and matte boxes. The 14-35mm lens is lightweight and comfortable to use with today’s smaller 4K cameras. For shooters looking for a lightweight zoom that can be used as a handheld, capturing wide angles in tight spaces, it’s ideal.
The PL 14-35 covers 31.5mm sensor size on a digital cinema style camera. While sensors on standard broadcast cameras are all the same size, sensors on digital cine cameras vary greatly. This new zoom ensures the image captured will cover large sensors for optimal, full-frame resolution. A nine-blade iris part of the design as well, creating the most natural-looking imagery possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For shooters and productions on the go, Litepanels' Sola 4 Flight Kit provides three Sola 4 LED Fresnel fixtures in a rugged travel friendly trolley style hard case for easy and safe transport from location to location. The Sola 4 is the smallest DMX controllable LED Fresnel on the market, the daylight-balanced Sola 4™ offers the controllability and light-shaping properties inherent in a Fresnel light at a small fraction of the power draw of conventional fixtures. The Litepanels Sola 4 fixtures which offer an output comparable to a 125W HMI can be powered with the included AC power cables and the possibility to be powered from a professional camera battery via optional battery adapter cables. The three fixtures included in the kit can be deployed for a classic 3-light setup, and the custom foam in the case provides room to expand by adding a Litepanels 1x1.

		<description><![CDATA[The Litepanels Hilio D12 (Daylight Balanced) panel delivers the best of both worlds, combining the flexibility of an open source fixture with all the benefits of Litepanels’ proprietary LED fixture designs. These innovative panels emit a raw, narrow beam that provides the high intensity you need for long throws. With an array of optional accessories, this intensity can be harnessed and shaped to light an exterior, wash a set with soft light, or illuminate a cyc wall or green screen. The Hilio D12 is four times brighter than the previous version of Hilio. There’s no need for a heavy ballast or cabling, as the environmentally friendly and energy efficient Hilio D12 fixture draws only 350 watts of electricity, but deliver the output of a 575W HMI Par.

]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[High intensity, a narrow beam, and a wide range of accessories make these versatile fixtures essential in Broadcast Studios or on Feature/Episodic/Commercial location shoots.
Low power consumption, reduced HVAC requirements, and no associated bulb replacement costs contribute to a return on your investment (ROI) in less than three years for typical studio applications.
Incredibly energy efficient, these panels draw only 350W but are comparable to the output of a 575W HMI Par.
No UV or infrared wavelengths are emitted by any of our fixtures.
Microprocessor operated, active cooling system that automatically adjusts to the ambient temperature.
Flicker-free at any frame rate or shutter angle.
Ultra-smooth dimming from 100% to 0, with no noticeable color shift throughout the entire range.
Our unique Nanoptic lenses convert the powerful open source into a soft light or broad directional fill, delivering flexibility for almost any application.
Integrated DMX module, with RJ45 Ethernet connections for remote dimming control with any standard DMX512 protocol device.
Integrated slots hold color and diffusion gel filters and Nanoptic lenses.
Standard Yoke with Junior Pin to enable easy mounting and positioning.
User-friendly LCD display and a multi-functional control with menu-based button interface.
Removable, external power supply with convenient mounting bracket and other options.

		<description><![CDATA[The ASTRA 1x1 Bi-Color panel builds on the legacy of the original 1x1 fixture, which revolutionized the lighting industry. This innovative daylight to tungsten tunable color model was years in the making, with every design element of this next generation panel being meticulously crafted. Following the Litepanels tradition of a one square foot form factor, the ASTRA series is designed with select premium quality, high CRI, surface mount LEDs and paired with custom designed TIR optics. These tightly binned LEDs and fine-tuned optics provide the ASTRA 1x1 with superior color reproduction and a light output that is up to four times brighter than traditional LED panels. This higher intensity results in a longer throw and illuminates a wider area, allowing the panel to compete with strong exterior light sources or illuminate a large area effectively with just a single fixture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The PXW-X500 has three 2/3-inch type Full HD CCD sensors, offering a high sensitivity and low noise image. The camcorder gives broadcasters a high degree of flexibility, allowing you to shoot in a wide variety of HD and SD formats, including XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP, MPEG SStP 422 Lite (HDCAM SR), MPEG HD 422 and MPEG HD 420, as well as MPEG IMX and DVCAM. Options allow the camcorder to record directly in Avid DNxHD and Apple ProRes, offering direct compatibility with NLEs. The camcorder also has a host of leading professional features, such as Slow & Quick Motion up to 30 fps for MPEG HD 422 (as standard) and up to 120 fps for XAVC (as an option), wireless operation, picture cache recording, built-in GPS, Digital Extender, variable ND filter control, HyperGamma, and many more. A wide range of connectors, including 3G/HD/SD-SDI, HDMI and USB, increase the flexibility further.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[New CCD Imager	The PXW-X500 is equipped with three 2/3-inch type Full HD CCD sensors. Based on the latest on-chip lens structure, this type of CCD offers a high sensitivity of F11 at 60i (F12 at 50i) and improved S/N ratio of 60 dB (with NS on). The camcorder also offers minimum illumination of 0.016 lx (typical) in 1080/59.94i mode +42 dB gain, with 16-frame accumulation.
High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Log GOP recordings	The PXW-X500 supports not only MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps in MXF (Material eXchange Format), which is widely accepted by major broadcasters worldwide, but also XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP codecs. XAVC technology is based on the H.264 standard, which provides an exceptional performance compression technology. XAVC Intra (frame) compression means that every frame is encoded independent of the other frames – providing a better quality picture, without compromises. With a Long GOP codec, only certain frames are encoded individually. This allows the codec to squeeze the video into a much smaller bitrate than Intra technology. The main benefit is faster ingest and editing. XAVC Long GOP files also require less storage space than XAVC Intra files, providing budget savings on recording media. The XAVC codec adopts 10 bit sampling for high definition recording with rich tonal expression. The bit rate of XAVC recording is 111 or 112 Mbps at 1080/59.94i or 50i and 89, or 112 Mbps at 1080/23.98P or 25p. The high bit rate gives a better quality picture.
Switchable recordings for greater flexibility	As well as shooting at XAVC HD, MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps and MPEG HD 420 35 Mbps, the camcorder also supports MPEG SStP 422 Lite (HDCAM SR), as well as SD MPEG IMX and DVCAM at 25 Mbps in MXF file format. MPEG HD 422 gives a high quality image with more detailed color reproduction, as well as being ideal for chromakeying. MPEG SStP is offered at 1080 59.94i, 50i, 29.97p, 23.98p and 25p. High-quality MPEG HD422 50 Mbps is fully compliant with the latest EBU recommendations for long-form broadcast production and is widely accepted in broadcasting stations and production houses. This recording capability makes the PXW-X500 ideal for a wide range of different applications, including newsgathering and documentary production.
Open workflows with Avid DNxHD® codec and Apple ProRes 422 codec recording options	Sony understands a fundamental truth: working cameras require practical workflows that provide open standards. That's why the PXW-X500 is part of a larger production platform that includes affordable media cards, affordable card readers and compatibility with popular NLEs and finishing tools. Recording directly in the Apple ProRes 422 codec and Avid DNxHD® codec are also available as hardware options.* The Avid DNxHD® files or Apple ProRes 422 files are recorded onboard to Sony’s SxS PRO+ memory card format, which was specially designed to handle mission-critical production applications. 
* Apple ProRes 422 codec option PXWK-501 and Avid DNxHD® codec option PXWK-502 are planned to be available in Feb 2015
Slow and Quick Motion function 1 fps to 120 fps at 1080 in XAVC Intra and XAVC Long* and 1 fps to 30 fps in MPEG HD 422	The PXW-X500 offers a powerful Slow and Quick Motion function as an option that enables users to create elegant fast- and slow-motion footage. The PXW-X500 can capture images at frame rates selectable from 1 fps (frame per second) to 120 fps in 1080p in the XAVC codec. It offers approx. 5x slow motion at 23.98p, 4.5x slow motion at 25p and 4x slow motion at 29.97p. In MPEG HD 422 codec, the camcorder offers as a standard feature the ability to capture from 1 fps to 30 fps in 1080p mode, in increments of 1 fps. (frame rates are selectable up to 30 fps in 1080p mode.) * Slow & Quick Motion function for XAVC is available as option PXWK-503.
Dual SxS media slots, “Simul” or “Relay” recording, and independent record control	The PXW-X500 is equipped with two SxS memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with SxS PRO+ and SxS-1 memory cards, XQD, SDXC and SDHC cards can be also used with an appropriate card adaptor. Two media slots can record in either “Simul” or “Relay” mode. “Simul” mode permits simultaneous recording to two memory cards, while “Relay” mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. The user can set up the two Start/Stop buttons on the PXW-X500, one on the grip and one on the camcorder body, to independently start and stop recording on different memory cards while recording in Simul mode.
Wide choice of connections	The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including 3G HD-SDI, HDMI®, USB, composite output, timecode input/output and genlock input. The 3G-SDI connector is able to output the 1080/59.94P or 50P signal. Down-conversion output from HD to SD is also possible. Simultaneous output from both SDI and HDMI is possible. The Rec Trigger signal can be sent through SDI and HDMI to link an external recording device.
GPS functionality	The PXW-X500 is equipped with a GPS device. The GPS data is automatically recorded to the card in the MXF file and as XML in a separate “side car” .log file.
Digital Extender	The digital extender function of the PXW-X500 enables images to be digitally increased in size 2x, 3x or 4x without F-stop loss.
Viewfinder options	The camcorder allows various functions to be displayed in the viewfinder, including Focus Mag and Waveform / Vectorscope / Histogram. Viewfinder options include the HDVF-20A and HDVF-200 B/W viewfinders or the CBK-VF02 color viewfinder.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon CINE-SERVO 50-1000mm T5.0-8.9 ultra-telephoto zoom lens provides 4K performance for Super35mm large-format single-sensor cameras and accommodates either broadcast or cinema-style production due to its removable Digital Drive unit. Available in EF- or PL- mount versions, the lens delivering the world's longest focal length (75-1500mm with its built-in 1.5x extender) and highest (20x) magnification among super 35mm zoom lenses as of October 16, 2014. The lens is great for sports, nature documentaries, and other types of long-zoom field production, yet it's easy to carry, has a relatively compact form factor of only 16.3 inches in length, and a weight of just 14.6 lbs. It can be used with major brands of single-sensor Super35mm cameras and conforms to industry-standard camera-to-lens communication protocols including 12-pin serial communication (common to major broadcast camera brands) and Canon EOS technology.

The CINE-SERVO 50-1000mm T5.0-8.9 ultra-telephoto zoom lens allows for close-up 4K imaging of wildlife subjects while still maintaining the physical distances necessary in such shooting situations. Ruggedly built, its removable Digital Drive unit allows for broadcast-style operation with a convenient zoom/rocker switch, programmable zoom and focus settings, and data connections for use with broadcast-type field/studio zoom and focus servo-demand controls. Removal of the Drive unit enables Cinema-style operation; the lens includes clearly engraved barrel markings, an 11-blade iris to help achieve smooth "bokeh" backgrounds, and compatibility with lens-support rods, matte boxes, and other cinema accessories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The extremely compact Genelec 8010A studio monitor allows professionals to work in small studios and on the move with an accurate monitoring tool.

Exceptional sound qualities, small size and universal mains input voltage make 8010A’s perfect companions while on the move. With a balanced XLR input, 3-inch woofer, 3/4-inch tweeter and two efficient Class D power amplifiers, 8010A’s produce more undistorted sound pressure level than you might expect. It features Genelec Intelligent Signal Sensing (ISS™) circuitry which switches the monitor to standby when no audio input is detected (ErP 2013 Directive).

		<description><![CDATA[The EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera is an evolutionary 2nd generation Cinema EOS 4K camera system with a wide range of new and improved features including 4K/2K/Full HD internal and external recording (including 4K RAW output) and a new 10-bit Canon Log 2 Gamma. This powerful new camera also features an expanded dynamic range of 15 stops, improved Dual Pixel CMOS Autofocus, innovative focus assist engineering and CFast recording technology. Redesigned with the help of user input, the EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera helps to deliver more creative flexibility for professional studio motion picture production applications, as well as independent productions, TV dramas, commercials, news features, sports and more. 

The EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera integrates a re-designed imaging system of advanced components. These include a newly developed 8.85 Megapixel Canon Super 35mm 16:9 CMOS image sensor that supports up to 4K (DCI) recording with a maximum resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels and a high-speed readout for reduced rolling-shutter distortion. Working in concert with its dual Canon DIGIC DV5 image processors, data from the 4K sensor delivers Over-Sampling HD Processing for reduced-moiré 2K(DCI)/Full 1080-60p HD recording and Dual-Pixel CMOS Auto Focus with an expanded focusing area and Face Detection (in combination with Canon EF lenses). The dual DIGIC DV5 image processors also help to reduce visual noise and enable high-sensitivity shooting at a maximum speed of ISO 102,400 (+54dB) for sharp, clear image capture using only ambient lighting. In addition to its sensor and processors, the EOS C300 Mark II camera also incorporates a trio of XF-AVC H.264 codecs that enable in-camera 4K (DCI) recording to dual CFast card slots and 2K/Full HD recording to an SD card slot. For external recording and monitoring, twin 3G-SDI outputs capable of 4K RAW output are included on the rear of the camera body Users can choose among multiple recording modes, resolutions and frame rates to meet their production needs. 

Creative flexibility is also greatly enabled by the EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera’s compatibility with the full range of more than 100 Canon EF and EF-S photographic lenses (including specialty tilt-shift and fisheye models) and Canon CN-E Cinema prime and zoom lenses (including the "ENG-style" Canon CINE-SERVO zooms). New Dual-Pixel CMOS AF capabilities of the EOS C300 Mark II are enabled by the AF motors in Canon EF lenses. The improved EF lens communication capabilities of the EOS C300 Mark II camera allow for the display of CN-E Cinema lens T-values, lens metadata acquisition, and chromatic aberration correction on the camera’s LCD Monitor/EVF/Output display. 

Operability improvements of the Canon EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera that further facilitate operation and creative freedom include full manual control, an Ultra-High Resolution 1.77 Megapixel color OLED EVF with adjustable 60º tilting angle, a built in internal mono reference microphone, a removable hand grip, an improved camera handle extension with additional attachment points, and a removable LCD Monitor and control panel with XLR inputs. The modular design of the EOS C300 Mark II camera also allows for many kinds of industry-standard accessories to be added or removed as need]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[UWP Series UHF synthesized wireless microphone system. Package includes a lavalier microphone, bodypack transmitter and tuner module. Channels 30 to 33. The UWP-X7 includes extremely robust metal construction, mic/line input selection on the bodypack transmitter and a uni-directional lav microphone. ]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[PLL Synthesized System	Achieves stable transmission and reception by using a UHF PLL (Phase Locked Loop) frequency synthesized system, which provides accurate carrier signal frequencies. This system is used in both the transmitters and tuners, so that a stable carrier is generated at the transmitter, and accurately tuned in at the tuner. This PLL-controlled system provides highly stable, user-selectable frequencies in increments of 125 kHz.
Space Diversity Reception System	Typically, wireless microphone transmission systems can be subject to reception interruptions (signal dropout), but UWP series tuners reduce this to a minimum. By utilizing a space-diversity reception system, it achieves stable reception by using dual-antenna inputs/reception circuits. These receive signals over two different paths and automatically select the stronger RF signal for output.
Tone Squelch Circuitry	To avoid picking up carrier signals transmitted from other systems, the transmitter transmits a 32 kHz pilot-tone signal along with the audio signal. The tuner's squelch circuit recognizes this tone signal, and outputs the audio signal only when this tone signal is received. This function prevents the output of unwanted signals and noise from other signal transmissions in the air, as well as the RF noise and popping noise that occur when the transmitter is powered on or off.
Simultaneous Multi-Channel Operation	Simultaneous operation of up to 16 wireless microphones. Optimum combinations of practically tested, interference-free frequencies are stored in the tuner. By using the pre-programmed frequency groups, users can easily choose interference-free frequencies for the transmitters and tuners, simplifying the task of system setup.]]></features>
		<specifications><![CDATA[Frequency Range	566 MH to 590 MHz (TV channels 30 to 33) Users may choose from 188 frequencies on each model
Occupied RF Bandwidth	24 MHz
Compatibility	For use with UWP Series wireless products operating on the same frequencies]]></specifications>

		<description><![CDATA[The DP7-PRO High Bright Field Monitor features a 1500 nit, 720p IPS LCD which is 3x brighter than traditional LCD displays. Having a screen this bright makes it easy to monitor outdoors—especially if the camera operator is unable to utilize a sun hood. In addition to many camera specific presets for REC 709, the DP7-PRO is able to detect and display your custom 3D LUTs from any color grading application, allowing you to view a graded image in real time. The DP7-PRO Field Monitor allows operators to
assign up to 24 functions to “Smart Keys” for instant access. This prevents the need to enter the menu system, saving time & sanity. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Full HD XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP recordings and MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps offer budget savings and workflow flexibility for broadcast and professional applications

The PXW-X160 three 1/3-inch type Exmor™ CMOS sensors camcorder records Full HD XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP, as well as MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps MPEG HD 420 35 Mbps, AVCHD and DV, making it ideal for a wide range of applications from education/videography to broadcast. As the successor of HVR-Z7 and HXR-NX5, the PXW-X160 has a lot of attractive features, including dual SxS memory card slots, a G Series fixed 25x HD zoom lens with 26mm wide angle and variable ND filter, that provides four conventional mechanical 4 ND filter positions or a linear switch dial for more control in changing light conditions.

Three 1/3-inch type Exmor™ CMOS Full HD sensors
High resolution, high sensitivity, low noise, and wide dynamic range for enhanced shooting under severe lighting conditions and more creative freedom.

G Series fixed 25x professional HD zoom lens
26mm wide angle zoom with three independent rings with end-stop and large focal length.

High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP recordings on SxS memory cards
Supports XAVC Intra and Long GOP codecs, as well as MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps, the widely-accepted broadcast standard compliant with the latest EBU recommendations. The PXW-X160 also records in MPEG HD 420 35 Mbps, AVCHD and DV, offering flexibility and budget savings on recording media.

Dual ND filter control mechanism for more flexibility
The PXW-X160 is equipped with a variable ND Filter function. Users can chose either four conventional mechanical ND filter positions or the linear control dial, allowing you to quickly and smoothly adapt to different conditions of shooting]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Features	Benefits:
Three 1/3-inch type Exmor CMOS Full HD sensors for a wide range of shooting conditions	The PXW-X160 incorporates three 1/3-inch type Full-HD Exmor CMOS sensors to achieve high resolution, high sensitivity, low noise, and wide dynamic range. The sensor has 2 million effective pixels and achieves full HD 1920 x 1080 shooting without pixel interpolation, enhancing shooting under severe lighting conditions and providing more freedom of creative expression.
25x professional HD optical zoom lens with three independent rings with end-stop and large focal length	The PXW-X160 is equipped with a G Series fixed 25x optical zoom lens with 26mm wide-angle. Due to a quick electric zoom function, the change of shooting from wide-angle to tele-angle can be made quickly. The lens has three independent control rings with end-stop, which means focus, zoom and iris can be manually controlled, making for better and faster adjustment.
Variable dual ND filter control mechanism	The PXW-X160 is equipped with a variable ND Filter function, allowing you to choose either four conventional mechanical ND filter positions or the linear control dial. The optical filter changes the density electrically, allowing the light amount to be reduced more conveniently. The density can be changed gradually and fluidly. Different from conventional optical ND filters, the ND filter on the PXW-X160 can be controlled from 1/4ND to 1/128ND linearly. By choosing the density value properly, the iris control has more flexibility.
High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Log GOP recordings	The PXW-X160 supports not only MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps in MXF (Material eXchange Format), which is widely accepted by major broadcasters worldwide, but also XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP codecs. XAVC technology is based on the H.264 standard, which provides an exceptional performance compression technology. XAVC Intra (frame) compression means that every frame is encoded independent of the other framesz providing a better quality picture, without compromises. With a Long GOP codec, only certain frames are encoded individually. This allows the codec to squeeze the video into a much smaller bitrate than Intra technology. The main benefit is faster ingest and editing. XAVC Long GOP files also require less storage space than XAVC Intra files, providing budget savings on recording media. The XAVC codec adopts 10 bit sampling for high definition recording with rich tonal expression. The bite rate of XAVC recording is 111 or 112 Mbps at 1080/59.94i or 50i and 89, or 112 Mbps at 1080/23.98P or 25p. The high bit rate gives a better quality picture.
Dual SxS media slots, “Simultaneous” or “Relay” recording, and independent record control	The PXW-X160 is equipped with two SxS memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with SxS PRO+ and SxS-1(*2) memory cards. XQD card can also be used with the adaptor QDA-EX1. Two media slots can record in either “Simultaneous” or “Relay” mode. “Simultaneous” mode permits simultaneous recording to two memory cards, while “Relay” mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. The user can set up the two Start/Stop buttons on the PXW-X160, one on the grip and one on the camcorder body, to independently start and stop recording on different memory cards while recording in Simultaneous mode. 

(*2) Some selected recording mode is not supported.
OLED Viewfinder and 3.5” type LCD Panel	This 0.5" type OLED viewfinder has the incredible clarity of 1024 x 768 pixels, plus superb OLED brightness, contrast and response. The high resolution of the viewfinder allows better precision of manual focus operations and eliminates any colour-breaking phenomenon. The 3.5” type QHD LCD panel provides easy viewing in a wide range of lightning conditions.
Wide choice of connections	The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including 3G HD-SDI, HDMI, USB, composite output, timecode input/output and genlock input. The 3G-SDI connector is able to output the 1080/59.94P or 50P signal. Down-conversion output from HD to SD is also possible. Simultaneous output from both SDI and HDMI is possible. The recording trigger signal can be sent through SDI and HDMI to link an external recording device.
Multi Interface Shoe (MI Shoe) for flexible connection without XLR cable	The PXW-X160 is equipped with a Multi Interface Shoe (MI Shoe) that has an electric interface in its mechanical attachment allowing the camcorder to communicate with an attached accessory. For example, the audio signal from a UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 wireless microphone package can be input from the wireless microphone receiver to the PXW-X160 without an XLR cable. The power can be supplied from the PXW-X160 to the receiver and a battery is not required for the receiver operation.

		<description><![CDATA[The highly respected HDW-F900 camcorder has now been refined into the next-generation HDW-F900R, offering a variety of further enhanced functionalities. ; The HDW-F900R camcorder records images in accordance with the CIF (Common Image Format) standard, which specifies a sampling structure of 1920 x 1080 active pixels (horizontal x vertical). Plus, as well as recording at 24P, the HDW-F900R camcorder is switchable to record at 25P, 29.97P progressive scan, and also at 50 or 59.94 Hz interlaced scan.; The camcorder also provides a comprehensive range of features for creative shooting such as enhanced gamma features and colorimetry controls.; Plus, the design of the HDW-F900R is highly compact and lightweight, giving users higher levels of mobility and comfort when shooting.; To further enhance the creative and operational versatility of the camcorder, a wide range of optional accessories are available. These include a picture cache board, a 2-3 Pull-down and down converter board, and a slow-shutter board.; In combination with its renowned 24P capability and attractive cost efficiency, all of these great functionalities make the HDW-F900R the perfect solution for shooting television series , documentaries, commercials, as well as motion pictures.;]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[HAD sensor technology
The HDW-F900R uses Hyper HAD sensor technology incorporating the latest FIT sensor and on-chip lens structure. Three 2/3-inch FIT CCDs each with 2.2 million-pixels provide excellent imaging quality acquiring pictures at 1920 x 1080 CIF (Common Interchange Format) resolution.
12 bit ADSP
12 bit A/D conversion and advanced digital signal processing ensures excellent tonal reproduction, for the most demanding applications.
Choice of Multiple frame rates
You can select from a number of frame rates to match the required look for each production. 50i and 59.94i can be selected to acquire interlaced "TV look" pictures, with 23.98P, 24P, 25P and 29.97P also available for "film look" (progressive) images. Please note that 30P and 60i modes are not supported.
TruEye Processing
TruEye virtually eliminates hue distortion, especially in extreme lighting conditions. TruEye processes videa data in a similar way to the human eye - processing brightness, hue and saturation. This significantly improves the reproduction of natural skin tones.
Multi Matrix
Multi Matrix provides further in-camera creative control and can be used to match colourimetry during multiple camcorder shoots. It is also effective for manipulating the hue and saturation of specific selected colours within a scene. One example would be to adjust the hue and saturation of a flower petal without changing other colours within the picture.
Auto Trace White
Auto Trace White (ATW) is a feature that automatically adjusts the white balance as lighting conditions change. This is ideal when shooting in rapidly changing lighting conditions (for example, when moving from an indoor to an outdoor location). Conventional Auto White Balance is also available.
Creative control with User Gamma
The CvpFileEditor can be used with the HDW-F900R for creation of custom gamma curves. Existing gamma curves, generated for use with the original HDW-F900 can also be applied.
Long record duration onto HDCAM cassettes
The HDW-F900R records up to 50 minutes onto a small HDCAM tape when shooting in 24P mode. Maximum record durations at 50i and 59.94i are 48 minutes and 40 minutes.
Dual optical filter wheel
The HDW-F900R is equipped with dual optical filter wheels. You can choose from the following Neutral Density (ND) settings: CLEAR, 1/4ND, 1/16ND and 1/64ND, and the following Colour Correction (CC) settings A:5600K, B:3200K, C:4300K and D:6300K.
Optional HD to SD down conversion
The HKDW-702 HD to SD downconverter option used with the HDW-730S and HDW-750P HDCAM camcorders can be used with the HDW-F900R. SDI or analogue VBS can be output from the camcorder when this option is fitted. Alternatively, the new HKDW-902R board can be installed. In addition to downconvertion, 2-3 pulldown is supported which allows NTSC monitoring at 59.94i when the camcorder is running at 23.98PsF.
Slow Shutter and Image Inversion
The new HKDW-905R option can be installed into the HDW-F900R to add slow shutter capability (up to 64 frames) and image inversion. The slow shutter feature can be used to either boost sensitivity or to enable motion blur to be used as a creative tool. Image inversion allows the camcorder to be used with a wider range of anamorphic and film.
Picture Cache Recording
It's always annoying to miss a great shot, especially when shooting wildlife footage. Picture cache recording provides an additional chance to capture the action even if it occurred before the REC button was pressed. An optional HKDW-703 can be installed into the camcorder to provide this feature. This allows you to capture up to 8 seconds of material immediately before you press the record button.
Time Lapse
The HKDW-703 also provides Time Lapse (Interval) Recording. In MANUAL mode, 1 to 8 frames are recorded each time the REC button is pressed. In AUTO mode, the overall recording time is set (e.g. 10 minutes) along with the playback time on tape (e.g. 10 seconds). Using the picture cache to achieve Time Lapse reduces the mechanical wear to the record mechanism.
More choices for signal output
The HDW-F900R is equipped with two HD-SDI outputs as standard, allowing high definition pictures to be monitored directly on-site without the need for an additional adapter. One of these outputs can be switched to standard definition when the camcorder is fitted with an optional HKDW-702 or HKDW-902R board.
Same optical axis as the original HDW-F900
The HDW-F900R uses the same optical axis as the original HDW-F900. The lens accessories developed for the HDW-F900 can be used without modification.
Great audio performance
Four channels of digital audio can be input to the HDW-F900R via two XLR inputs. Each XLR receives 2 channels of AES/EBU audio data at 20 bits resolution.
Slot-in wireless receiver
You can slot a Sony wireless receiver directly into the chassis of the HDW-750P. This adds wireless receiver functionality without compromising the compact ergonomic design of the camcorder. A Sony WRR-855A/B can be used.
Rugged and ergonomic design
The design of the HDW-F900R is based on years of Sony experience in camera design and provides a high level of mobility and balance to minimise fatigue in all shooting conditions. Combined with the viewfinder, battery, cassette and microphone, the total weight is only 5.4 Kg.]]></features>

The Bolt Pro 600 offers all of the same great features of the 300 model, in addition to an OLED screen for quick RX pairing, manual frequency selection, external antennas, and a transmission range of up to 600ft line of sight. Bolt Pro 600 comes in HDMI, 3G-SDI, and dual I/O models.
All Bolt models support real-time format conversion from TX to RX, allowing you to automatically cross convert from HDMI to 3G-SDI (or vice versa) without any extra hardware. Each model also outputs a test pattern when the video signal is lost and both the 600 and 2000 models support quick RX pairing via the OLED screen and manual frequency selection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The CineSaddle is a unique camera support product that provides a stable base for a wide variety of shots with fast and easy setup. Use it as a replacement for a tripod or fluid head or mount it to any static or moving object.

The CineSaddle is filled with high tech foam balls that push the sides of the bag tight up against the camera holding it rock steady. In similar fashion the bottom of the CineSaddle molds itself to the shape of the object it is resting on preventing it from slipping. The foam balls also absorb vibration providing a very stable surface for the camera. The CineSaddle is also extremely lightweight and simple to set up.

The CineSaddle allows you to be creative because it can be used in so many ways. Place the camera and CineSaddle on any flat surface or on top of a tripod. You can even pan and tilt with the CineSaddle. With the included mounting kit you can strap the CineSaddle to any moving object and create a dolly.

The CineSaddle come in variety of models depending on your needs and the size of your camera. The Marsupial CineSaddle is a full size saddle for professional cameras ranging in size from Broadcast HD to compact HD models. It includes a mounting kit and storage pouch for DV size cameras or bulky accessories.

Lightweight at 3.5 lb, the Mini Jib arm collapses to 33" and can extend up to nearly 6'. The jib will require a strong and steady tripod for support.

These light, lower-cost alternatives to the Summilux-C provide incredible performance with full coverage up to and including the new RED dragon sensor.]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Aperture
The T2.0 Leica Summicron-C
prime lenses are built with high
ASA/ISO digital cameras in mind,
offering plenty of depth of field
and performance while maintaining
a compact size.

Focusing
The classic linear focus scale of the
Summicron-C lenses is familiar to
camera assistants around the world.
Focus rolls in gently allowing for
smooth pulls without the unpleasant
sudden snap of sharpness.

Size
Advances in cine lens design allow
the Summicron-C lenses to be
smaller and more compact than
other lenses with comparable
performance. Only 4” (101mm) long
and weighing between 2.9 and 3.4
pounds (1.3-1.6kg), these lenses
are perfect for stabilized rigs,
aerial cinematography, underwater
cinematography, and stereoscopic 3D.

Image Circle
Digital camera sensors are getting
physically larger and the Leica
Summicron-C lenses are ready to
perform. Each lens offers an image
circle wider than 35mm in diameter,
big enough to easily cover the newest
sensors from RED, Sony, and ARRI.]]></features>

		<features><![CDATA[Aperture
The T2.0 Leica Summicron-C
prime lenses are built with high
ASA/ISO digital cameras in mind,
offering plenty of depth of field
and performance while maintaining
a compact size.

Focusing
The classic linear focus scale of the
Summicron-C lenses is familiar to
camera assistants around the world.
Focus rolls in gently allowing for
smooth pulls without the unpleasant
sudden snap of sharpness.

Size
Advances in cine lens design allow
the Summicron-C lenses to be
smaller and more compact than
other lenses with comparable
performance. Only 4” (101mm) long
and weighing between 2.9 and 3.4
pounds (1.3-1.6kg), these lenses
are perfect for stabilized rigs,
aerial cinematography, underwater
cinematography, and stereoscopic 3D.

Image Circle
Digital camera sensors are getting
physically larger and the Leica
Summicron-C lenses are ready to
perform. Each lens offers an image
circle wider than 35mm in diameter,
big enough to easily cover the newest
sensors from RED, Sony, and ARRI.]]></features>

		<description><![CDATA[mLink R supports a single PCIe card and is the industry's smallest and lightest Thunderbolt Expansion Chassis to support 3/4 length boards.  mLink R features two 10Gbit/second Thunderbolt ports and enables daisy-chaining of up to six additional Thunderbolt devices including other mLinks, storage devices, mDP monitors and Apple Thunderbolt Displays.  DVI, HDMI and VGA monitors can also be part of the chain when used with mDP adapters.  mLink R also provides 10W of power to support bus-powered Thunderbolt peripherals.
]]></description>
		<features><![CDATA[Thunderbolt I/O - Ultrafast Performance 

Thunderbolt technology enables mLink R to transfer data at up to 10Gbps.  That's 20x faster than USB 2, 12x faster than FireWire 800 and 2x faster than USB 3. When loaded with a RAID controller (Atto R680) and attached to eight SATA III drives, mLink R cranks out over 700 MB/second of throughput for the most demanding content creation applications.
Innovative Design - Solid Engineering

mLink R features a PCIe x16 slot (x4 electrical) and accommodates PCIe cards such as professional audio/video capture boards and RAID adapters.  A temperature controlled, variable speed fan keeps the installed card optimally cool without excessive noise.  And mLink R powers on and off with the Mac to save power.
The Perfect Solution for the RED ROCKET 

mLink R is by far the most compact Thunderbolt enclosure for the RED ROCKET.  And, mLink R features two BNC cutouts on the back panel to mount the ROCKET BNC connectors.  Mobile REDCINE X workflows have never been easier!]]></features>
		<specifications><![CDATA[PCIe Adapter Compatibility:	Up to Full-Length, Full or Half-Height adapters with a Thunderbolt-aware driver.

		<description><![CDATA[On seven continents, in the most demanding shooting conditions imaginable, Trost sliders have been used to provide dependably precise camera movement. We are now introducing a new Trost slider, called the M-series. Featuring native Mitchell mounts and leveling 100mm ball support, as well an an ultra low-profile and compact design, the M-series once again redefines the camera slider.

Weighing just 18 pounds, a Trost slider can support a fully kitted Arri Alexa or RED Epic – up to 560lbs – with zero observable deflection of the rail. In fact, the heavier the camera rig, the smoother a Trost will roll. Motion is so precise that even macro and long lens shots are comfortable and repeatable.

Trost sliders can be quickly and easily configured for many types of shooting applications. A Mitchell mount with removable key allows operators to quickly adjust the angle of motion. A wide variety of mounting options, including Mitchell, 3/8, 1/4, and C-stands makes Trost compatible with most common tripod styles. Trost sliders can also be combined for 2-axis configuration, expanding the shooting envelope dramatically.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Anton Bauer CINE VCLX Battery is a 14.4v and 28v 560Wh NiMH battery that provides dual simultaneous outputs and is ideal for high current applications. Power output is via two 4-pin XLR connectors for 14.4v and one 3-pin XLR connector for 14.4v.
<br><Br>
This battery connects to the CINE VCLX charger and has an onboard computer that continuously communicates with the charger for maximum power efficiency. Exchanged information includes such factors as the battery age, self discharge, charge/discharge rate, cell imbalance and previously experienced charge/discharge cycles. Also built into the battery is an LCD monitor that accurately displays the percentage of remaining battery capacity at all times.
<br><br>
To protect against damage to the battery, this battery has a low voltage cut-off feature which will automatically shut off the battery at 12 volts.

		<description><![CDATA[With a 120 watt-hr capacity and the ability to sustain a 10Amp draw, the DIONIC HCX will run a 40 watt camera with a 20 watt light for 2 hours. The new motion detection feature incorporates a “deep sleep” setting that reduces battery self-discharge, allowing for extended periods of storage with minimal capacity loss. The battery may be “awakened” by the built in motion sensor. To provide precise run-time data, an enhanced LCD RealTime® fuel gauge has been incorporated to display up to nine hours of run-time (under low power load conditions) using a 7-segment display enclosed by four circular arcs that indicate 15-minute time intervals. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ASTRA 1x1 Bi-Color panel builds on the legacy of the original 1x1 fixture, which revolutionized the lighting industry. This innovative daylight to tungsten tunable color model was years in the making, with every design element of this next generation panel being meticulously crafted. Following the Litepanels tradition of a one square foot form factor, the ASTRA series is designed with select premium quality, high CRI, surface mount LEDs and paired with custom designed TIR optics. These tightly binned LEDs and fine-tuned optics provide the ASTRA 1x1 with superior color reproduction and a light output that is up to four times brighter than traditional LED panels. This higher intensity results in a longer throw and illuminates a wider area, allowing the panel to compete with strong exterior light sources or illuminate a large area effectively with just a single fixture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Meeting the ever-increasing demands on image quality that digital photography brings, the redesigned EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM is the latest update to the acclaimed L-Series of EF optics, re-establishing a new standard for superb optics, high-end durable construction and performance in professional zoom lenses. A standard focal length zoom lens, it features a large aperture throughout its focal length. Featuring the latest advances in optical lens design, it utilizes 1 Super UD lens element and 2 UD lens elements that help minimize chromatic aberration in the periphery at wide-angle as well as reduced color blurring around the edges of the subject. In addition, 2 types of aspherical lenses are combined to help reduce spherical aberration over the entire image area as well as through the full zoom range. Optimized lens coatings also help ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting. The lens is also equipped with a circular 9-blade diaphragm for beautiful, soft backgrounds. A ring-type USM and high-speed CPU with optimized AF algorithms enable silent and fast autofocusing. Built for the rigors of professional use as well as to meet the increased number of shots available with digital photography, it's constructed with improved dust sealing and water resistance while fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens surfaces help reduce soiling, smears and fingerprints. A zoom lock lever locks the zoom position at the wide end for safe transporting while attached to an EOS DSLR camera over the shoulder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Canon XF205 Professional Camcorder is a compact, high-performance, high image quality system ideal for use with a variety of digital cinema and broadcast operations. Targeted at sports production, TV variety shows, commercials and drama shows, in addition to independent movie production, government applications, education, weddings and other social event videography, the camcorder features a wide-angle 20x optical zoom lens with three control rings, image stabilization, infrared capabilities, flexible MXF/MP4 dual recording at various data rates, two/four-channel audio recording, Wi-Fi® connectivity, plus 3G-SDI and monitor outputs as well as time code and genlock connections.

A versatile Canon 20x HD wide-angle video lens captures images with outstanding clarity across a broad 26.8–576 mm* zoom range. An eight-blade circular aperture provides natural and visually pleasing bokeh. Three separate rings control focus, zoom and iris settings. A new Five-Axis Dynamic SuperRange OIS System dramatically reduces the image-degrading effects of camera shake, and a new rotating handgrip enables comfortable camera positioning at shooting angles from high to low.

Dual-frequency Wi-Fi® and an Ethernet connector enable browser preview during shoots, in addition to FTP transfer to external servers, PCs or laptops. HD-SDI ports handle video with embedded audio and time code data for monitoring and recording of frame rates up to 30fps, and a new 3G-SDI port supports 1080p video at frame rates up to 60 fps. Time code I/O helps ensure frame-accurate sync during editing and post-production. The XF205 camcorder can also be used with Canon’s new RC-V100 Remote Controller to provide full access to important user functions, including start/stop, zoom/focus/iris, white balance and more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The CINE-SERVO 17-120mm T2.95-3.9 lens provides cinematographers and broadcast operations with a compact, lightweight design (only 6.4 lbs.) using Canon optical elements, while offering outstanding performance and reliability in professional shooting environments.
<p>
The new lens is fully 4K-ready, with a high optical resolution and support for Super35mm large-format cameras. An 11-blade aperture diaphragm helps ensure an artistic and beautiful representation of out-of-focus areas (or “Bokeh”).
<p>
The lens also features a high 7x zoom magnification, wide focal length range of 17mm to 120mm, and a 180º smooth rotating focus ring. Acknowledging that broadcasters often need to control zoom, focus and iris/aperture in different ways than filmmakers, Canon has developed this zoom lens with full external servo control for drama, documentary and other broadcast productions.
<p>
The servo drive unit is compatible with industry-standard protocols for control from a number of lens controllers including Canon’s standard broadcast lens controllers (ZSD-300D/FPD-400D) and multiple industry standard cinema lens controllers. The drive unit can be easily removed for cinema-style shoots and can be easily re-attached without any manual re-alignment. A 16-bit metadata output enables connection to virtual studio systems.
<p>
Also available in EF mount, the lens can be converted at an authorized Canon service facility.

		<description><![CDATA[Kino Flo's new Tegra® 4Bank DMX redefines the evolution of light by combining the Academy-award winning features of the 
4ft 4Bank portable system with onboard control features of the Diva-Lite 401. 

The all-in-one Tegra 4Bank DMX features new levels of control with DMX and onboard dimming, DMX and onboard lamp switching, remote hand-held dimming, and Universal input voltage (100VAC to 240VAC).  

The Tegra 4Bank DMX produces as much light as a 1000W tungsten softlight using only one third the amount of power at 
2.8A (120VAC) compared to the tungsten softlight at 8.3A.  Proprietary solid state electronics operate the lamps at high output, flicker-free, and dead quiet. 

The built-in barndoors with newly designed hinges, honeycomb louver and center mount system make the lightweight Tegra ideal for hand-held shots, rigging in tight locations or mounting on a light stand. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New optical design:  advanced 5-element/4-group optical design incorporating ultra-high index tanatalum-based optical glass to achieve extraordinary optical performance with improved corner sharpness, distortion and reduced vignetting.
Like the revolutionary original Metabones Speed Booster announced in January 2013, the Speed Booster ULTRA has a magnification of 0.71x, and so it effectively reduces the crop factor of mirrorless cameras with DX-sized sensors, such as Sony E-mount and Fuji X-mount cameras, from 1.5x to 1.07x.  However, the new ULTRA design makes very effective use of exotic materials at the furthest limit of glassmaking technology, and as a result is well corrected for use with virtually all fullframe SLR lenses regardless of exit pupil distance. Thus, the Speed Booster ULTRA performs extremely well with professional-grade f/2.8 zoom lenses such as the 24-70mm f/2.8 and 70-200mm f/2.8 zooms by Canon and Nikon to produce 17-50mm f/2.0 and 50-142mm f/2.0 high-speed zooms, respectively.  Similarly, high-speed fixed focal length lenses such as a 50mm f/1.2 will be transformed into a 35.5mm f/0.9 lens with excellent contrast and resolution from the center all the way to the edges of the image. ]]></description>

 • Advanced 5-element/4-group optical design incorporating ultra-high index tanatalum-based optical glass by Caldwell Photographic in the USA (patent pending).
• Electronic integration of aperture diaphragm, controlled by or from the camera body.
• Partial autofocus support for late-model (post-2006) Canon-brand lenses.
• Powered by camera body. No external power source required.
• High performance 32-bit processor and efficient switched-mode power supply.

		<description><![CDATA[High versatility and mobility for a variety of events bringing subjects up close and in shooting impressive portrait with beautifully defocused background. 

Comprising of 14 elements in 12 groups, the lens system features three aspherical lenses and two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses to achieve dramatic downsizing despite its powerful 10x optical zoom, while minimizing distortion and chromatic aberration.

The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) effectively compensates for not only small, fast movement but also large, slow one making it easy to shoot super clear shots even in low-lit situations such as in night time or indoors.

It is compatible with the sensor drive at max. 240 fps to take maximum advantage of cameras with high-speed AF. An inner focus drive system and stepping motor for smooth, silent operation to work with the camera's high-speed, high-precision contrast AF system for both photo and video recording.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Extension Unit offers multicamera support for PXW-FS7 including Apple ProRes 422 encoding

While the PXW-FS7 XDCAM camera comes with internal XAVC and MPEG-2 recording on XQD media you can attach the optional XDCA-FS7 Extension Unit. The box is attachable via a MultiPin connector so there are no hassles about cables. The Extension Unit offers additional I/O connectors like Timecode and Genlock for multi-camera operation or the possibility to use common V-Mount batteries. It also allows RAW data output to record 12-bit RAW footage on the AXS-R5 (in combination with HXR-IFR5), or another third party RAW recorder via the FS RAW Interface. The XDCA-FS7 will encode the video stream into the Apple ProRes 422 codec, which is then recorded on to the internal XQD media.

Apple ProRes 422 recording
A built-in Full HD ProRes encoding function enables ProRes-format recording to an XQD card in the camera.

* Firmware update, early 2015.

Allows 12-bit RAW recording on an external recorder
The XDCA-FS7 is needed for PXW-FS7 to record 12-bit RAW footage on the AXS-R5 (in combination with HXR-IFR5), or another third party RAW recorder. The RAW data will be outputted via the FS RAW Interface on the extension unit and is fully compatible with the NEX-FS700 RAW data.

Multi-camera operation

		<features><![CDATA[Attaches seamlessly to PXW-FS7 camera
The Extension Unit XDCA-FS7 can be connected directly to the PXW-FS7 XDCAM camera to enable the use of functions that support the operator's shooting style or workflow. The unit is attachable via a MultiPin connector so there are no hassles about cables. When using larger lenses, the Extension Unit will balance any possible front heaviness and increase the stability on the shoulder as well.

Developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), it is one of the most widely used compression schemes in the industry for camera acquisition, over the air broadcast, cable and satellite TV. Canon&rsquo;s adaptation of MPEG-2 for the XF300 Professional Camcorder, named the Canon XF Codec, ensures the widest compatibility with existing industry infrastructure and non-linear editing (NLE) systems. As well, by using an MXF file wrapper, video and audio can be wrapped in a single file along with important metadata.<BR><BR>The XF300 supports the highest HD quality with Full HD 1920x1080 resolution, up to 50Mbps bit rate and 4:2:2 color sampling.<BR><BR>4:2:2 color sampling provides twice the color resolution of HDV and other codecs that use 4:2:0 color sampling. 4:2:2 provides ultra-fine transitions in tone and color and maintains the highest quality image for use in post production processes such as chroma keying, color grading, advanced compositing and effects.<BR><BR>The codec&rsquo;s 50Mbps constant bit rate provides the bandwidth needed to capture the XF300&rsquo;s superior resolution and color in spectacular detail.<BR><BR>Record to Affordable Compact Flash Cards<BR><BR>Unlike other camcorders which use proprietary memory systems, the XF300 Professional Camcorder records to cost effective Compact Flash (CF) cards. The camcorder features two CF card slots and offers versatile recording functions including:<BR><BR>Relay recording:<BR>When one CF card becomes full, the camcorder automatically switches video recording to the other CF card.<BR>Hot swapping:<BR>Media can be replaced without turning off the camcorder. And while recording, the other card can be removed without interruption.<BR><BR>File copy and backup:<BR>Files may be copied from one card to the next &ndash; ideal for backing up when on location.<BR>Pre Record:<BR>Perfect for news crews and live event shooters, the camcorder continuously buffers approximately three seconds of video in memory. When the Record button is pressed, recording begins and the contents of buffer memory are added, so you never miss an important shot.<BR><BR>Major NLE Software Compatibility<BR><BR>Canon&rsquo;s XF Codec is supported by the industry&rsquo;s leading manufacturers: Adobe, Apple, Avid and Grass Valley.

The lens incorporates High Index &ndash; Ultra-low Dispersion (HI-UD), Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) and aspherical elements to minimize chromatic aberration while delivering a resolution of 1,000 TV lines.<BR><BR>In Full Manual Mode, the lens features mechanical stops for both the zoom and focus systems. Mechanical (Hard) end stops ensure that repeatable and dependable focus and zoom can be achieved when manually turning the lens barrel. These mechanical stops also allow for compatibility with many third-party remote camera controllers that require end stops in order to calibrate themselves. Additionally, display distance indicators on the lens barrel allow the operator to easily set the desired focus distance and move between focus points while recording.<BR><BR>For enhanced versatility and durability, the lens is equipped with three built-in glass, neutral density (ND) filters (&frac14;, 1/16 and 1/64) and a six-blade metal aperture iris.<BR><BR>SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer<BR>The XF300 also incorporates a newly designed SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization system (lens shift) with three modes: Standard, Dynamic and Powered.<BR><BR>Standard:<BR>Lens shift is controlled so that the maximum compensation angle is constant from wide angle through telephoto.<BR><BR>Dynamic:<BR>Stabilization changes throughout the zoom range to minimize more pronounced shaking. This is especially useful at wide-angle focal lengths when walking.<BR><BR>Powered:<BR>Vibration is suppressed at the telephoto end of the range, where shake is most apparent due to high magnification.<BR><BR>Instant AF<BR>When shooting high definition video, sharp focus becomes more critical than ever. Canon's proprietary Instant AF system combines an external AF sensor with Canon's legendary auto focus system for fast and accurate focus.

And both the built-in microphone and XLR inputs have the option for automatic or full manual gain control. To prevent variations in the recorded audio level, the dials can be locked by closing the audio panel cover.<BR><BR>Connectivity<BR><BR>Not only does the XF100 Professional Camcorder provide the professional user with complete control over the image, it also provides complete creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs including:<BR><BR>HDMI Output<BR>Component Video Output<BR>Composite Video Output (3.5mm Terminal)<BR>USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Terminal<BR>Remote Control Terminal (compatible with LANC protocol)<BR><BR>Additional Features<BR><BR>Waveform Monitor<BR>Videographers depend on this feature to confirm accurate exposure and color levels during the capture process. Typically only found on expensive external units, the Canon XF100 Professional Camcorder has a waveform monitor built right into the camera. The waveform monitor shows a detailed view of overall image brightness and RGB components.<BR><BR>Optional Canon WD-H58W Wide Converter<BR>Optically matched for the XF100&rsquo;s HD lens, the WD-H58W Wide Converter provides a magnification factor of 0,8x increasing wide angle capability to approximately 24mm (35mm equivalent).<BR><BR>Intelligent Battery System<BR>The XF100 Professional Camcorder is compatible with Canon&rsquo;s new BP-925, as well as the BP-955 and BP-975 Intelligent Lithium-ion batteries. These batteries communicate remaining running time (down to the minute) and wear data back to the camcorder, so the user is well-informed at all times. On the outside of the battery, four LED lamps allow battery life to be viewed quickly when in the field.<BR><BR>Additionally, the camcorder is compatible with existing Canon BP-900 series batteries. Batteries can also be inserted and removed while the supplied AC power cable is connected.<BR><BR>Photo Capture<BR>For applications such as storyboarding, continuity and publicity shots, the XF100 offers the ability to capture 1920 x 1080 still images.

Zeiss,Zeiss 1984-031 CZ.2 70-200/T2.9 PL - feet,1984-031,19900,19900,,"Carl Zeiss has introduced its first Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens to complement the Compact Prime CP.2 line of lenses. According to customer requests it is the first compact zoom lens of its kind with interchangeable mount and full frame capturing capability. The Compact Zoom CZ.2 gives the filmmaker the choice of a single lens in the short-long telephoto range, perfect for separating the fore- and background areas or for situations when the subject is a distance from the camera.<BR><BR>&ldquo;The Compact Zoom CZ.2 70-200/T2.9 is first in a line of zoom lenses designed for the owner-operator from Carl Zeiss that allows them to be used with a wide variety of current and future cameras, because of their compact design, full-frame coverage and interchangeable mounts&rdquo;, notes Christian Bannert, Senior Director R&amp;D, Carl Zeiss Camera Lens Division. &ldquo;There has never been a zoom lens on the market with similar features.&quot;<BR><BR>The Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens is a perfect complement to the smaller, lighter HD video and cine cameras introduced in the last year. Especially when used with Steadicam systems, the weight of the lens and camera becomes a critical factor. Weighing only 2.8kg (6.2lbs), it opens up new creative opportunities for action sequences by allowing the camera to be used hand-held for a greater range of motion. <BR><BR>The Compact Zoom CZ.2 lenses feature a 18-blade aperture, which creates a round iris opening and a natural, out of focus rendition. As with the rest of the Compact Prime CP.2 family, the cine-style housing with gearing allows the attachment of any standard follow-focus system. By using the interchangeable mounts for PL, EF, F, MFT and E, the Compact Zoom CZ.2 lens can be easily adapted to numerous camera systems and ensures compatibility with future cameras as technology changes. The Carl Zeiss T* anti-reflection coating ensures the maximum contrast and color rendition by minimizing stray light and ghosting within the lens.

Canon USA,Canon 5260B009 EOS 5D Mark III EF 24–105mm IS Kit,5260B009,5100,,,"Canon is proud to present the highly anticipated EOS 5D Mark III. With supercharged EOS performance and stunning full frame, high-resolution image capture, the EOS 5D Mark III is designed to perform. Special optical technologies like the 61-Point High Density Reticular AF and an extended ISO range of 100-25600 (expandable to 50 (L), 51200 (H1) and 102400 (H2) make the EOS 5D Mark III ideal for shooting weddings in the studio or out in the field, and great for still photography. Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes. Additional technological advancements include an Intelligent Viewfinder, Canon's advanced iFCL metering system, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Multiple Exposure mode - all of which that help make the EOS 5D Mark III the perfect multimedia tool.<BR><BR><BR><BR>What's in the Box:<BR>EOS 5D Mark III Body<BR>EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM Lens<BR>Lens Case LP1219<BR>Lens Hood EW-83H<BR>Eyecup Eg (not shown)<BR>Battery Pack LP-E6<BR>Battery Charger LC-E6<BR>Wide Neck Strap EW-EOS 5D Mark III<BR>Stereo AV Cable AVC-DC400ST<BR>USB Interface Cable IFC-200U<BR>Software Instruction Manual","22.3 Megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor <BR>The EOS 5D Mark III features a newly developed Canon full-frame 22.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor that's designed from the ground up to create high resolution, perfectly detailed images with unprecedented speed and clarity. A full 24 x 36mm, the sensor captures 5784 x 3861 large individual 6.25 &mu;m pixels and has a much-improved S/N ratio. A new photodiode structure with an increased photoelectric conversion rate increases the sensor's sensitivity by approximately 2 stops over previous models, meaning higher ISOs with the lowest noise of any EOS digital camera. And a 2-line 8-channel simultaneous signal readout means speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG) are possible!<BR><BR>14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) <BR>The EOS 5D Mark III not only offers 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, it delivers higher standard and expanded ISOs, and a score of new options to enhance shooting in varied and fast-changing lighting situations. With a standard range of ISO 100-25600, the EOS 5D Mark III represents a 2-stop increase in sensitivity over previous cameras. Thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the new sensor and powerful noise reduction, the EOS 5D Mark III can shoot at expanded sensitivities down to ISO 50 (L) and up to 51200 (H1), and even 102400 (H2)! <BR><BR>DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and blazing processing speed <BR>The EOS 5D Mark III uses a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG), and the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data processing performance and features new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration in both still and motion images. <BR><BR>All new 61-Point High Density Reticular AF <BR>The newly designed 61-Point High Density Reticular AF features an Offset Array Sensor (with staggering AF point arrangement) to deliver greater accuracy, no matter the situation. It offers multi-zone wide-area AF for better tracking, has 5 central dual cross-type points (f/2.8 diagonal), 21 central cross-type points (f/5.6 horizontal &amp; vertical) and 20 outer cross-type points (f/4.0 horizontal), and is sensitive in extremely low-light situations (EV-2 for a central point with a f/2.8 lens).<BR><BR>iFCL Metering with 63-zone dual-layering metering sensor <BR>The EOS 5D Mark III features Canon's multi-layer 63-zone iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminance) Metering System that integrates the cameras AF system into its readings. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding the chosen AF point(s), this new system delivers an entirely new level of accuracy, especially in situations where the light changes quickly. The metering sensor enables evaluative, center weighted, partial and spot metering, plus offers 5-step exposure compensation for perfectly exposed images, every time.<BR><BR>EOS HD Video with manual exposure control, multiple frame rates and selectable All i-frame or IPB compression. <BR>The EOS 5D Mark III offers both All-I and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding during recording only (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run), useful for multi-camera shoots. It also features improved sound recording adjustment capabilities, offering 64-step volume control accessible through the Quick Control screen during video shooting, plus a dedicated headphone jack for convenience in shooting.

Sony Electronics Inc,Sony ECM88B Electret Condenser Lavalier Microphone,ECM88B,663,,,"The ECM-88B is a miniature omni-directional electret-condenser microphone ideally suited for quality-critical applications in broadcasting, theater and field production. This lavalier mic achieves high-sensitivity and has a flat-and-wide frequency response. The ECM-88B offers extremely low handling noise with unparalleled high sound quality. The ECM-88B comes with a DC-78 power supply and it has a cable length of 8.2 feet. This model is best suited for wired lav mic applications. However; with the DC-78 power supply disconnected, the ECM-88B's 4-pin (SMC9-4P) connector can also be used with Sony WRT-822B and WRT-8B wireless mic body-pack transmitters.","Low handling noise&#9;Moving around while wearing a lavalier mic can often cause lav mic cables to rub against a users clothing. In many existing lavalier mic designs, this (frequently unavoidable) body movement can cause loud undesirable handling noise. The ECM-88B radically reduces this handling noise making it ideal for use in applications where users are moving.<BR>Flat-and-wide frequency response&#9;Many lavalier microphones are specifically optimized for speech reproduction and have limited use in other applications. The ECM-88B extends it's frequency response beyond the range of speech reproduction, and can be used for many high quality sound applications requiring a miniature mic that can easily be concealed.","Capsule Type&#9;<BR>Electret Condenser<BR><BR>Frequency Response&#9;<BR>20 Hz to 20 kHz<BR><BR>Directivity&#9;<BR>Omni-directional<BR><BR>Sensitivity&#9;<BR>-52 dB +/- 2 dB (when used with DC-78), -39.0 dB (11.2 mV) for BC.<BR><BR>Dynamic Range&#9;<BR>99 dB or more<BR><BR>S/N Ratio&#9;<BR>68 dB or more<BR><BR>Inherent Noise (0dB=20&micro;Pa)&#9;<BR>26 dB SPL or less<BR><BR>Induction Noise from External Magnetic Field&#9;<BR>5 dB SPL or less<BR><BR>Wind Noise&#9;<BR>45 dB SPL or less (with supplied windscreen, at 2 m/s)<BR><BR>Max SPL (dB SPL)(0dB=20&micro;P)&#9;<BR>125 dB SPL<BR><BR>Connector&#9;<BR>SMC9-4P 4-pin on microphone.

A standard focal length zoom lens, it features a large aperture throughout its focal length. Featuring the latest advances in optical lens design, it utilizes 1 Super UD lens element and 2 UD lens elements that help minimize chromatic aberration in the periphery at wide-angle as well as reduced color blurring around the edges of the subject.

Optimized lens coatings also help ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting. The lens is also equipped with a circular 9-blade diaphragm for beautiful, soft backgrounds. A ring-type USM and high-speed CPU with optimized AF algorithms enable silent and fast autofocusing. Built for the rigors of professional use as well as to meet the increased number of shots available with digital photography, it's constructed with improved dust sealing and water resistance while fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens surfaces help reduce soiling, smears and fingerprints.

"Aja Video Systems, Inc.","AJA Ki Pro Portable Digital File Recorder, with Apple ProRes 422",Ki Pro,2495,,,"Ki Pro established a new paradigm for tapeless video recorders by being the first recorder to offer support for creating Apple ProRes 422 files, which revolutionized how footage could be moved efficiently from production to editorial. Editors are able to work with footage immediately without the need for special file importers or transcoding steps. The workflow is simple: record with the Ki Pro, remove the the KiStor Storage Module from the Ki Pro and connect the KiStor Storage Module to the edit system via built-in connectivity.","Unify formats - speed workflows<BR>AJA's high-quality up/down/cross-conversion makes it easy to unify SD, 720p, and 1080i and create a single desired format for your project. The multitude of video and audio connections such as SDI, HDMI and analog make integrating Ki Pro with other production equipment easy.<BR><BR>RS-422 Control<BR>RS-422 control allows Ki Pro to integrate easily with supported editing systems and external controllers allowing it to fulfill several of the functions of a traditional VTR. Supported NLEs can even perform assemble edits directly to the Ki Pro.<BR><BR>Ki Pro's RS-422 control can also be used to link a traditional VTR with Ki Pro for direct editing control. Use the editing controls on properly equipped VTRs to control Ki Pro for machine-to-machine transfer of video and audio. This allows tape footage to be captured directly as files on Ki Pro without the need for a separate edit controller.<BR><BR>10-bit, full raster recording<BR>Big on quality - but not on file size. Recording 10-bit, full raster files, Ki Pro gives you high quality images that easily stand up to post processing requirements - and client scrutiny.<BR><BR>Compared to 8-bit recording devices, 10-bit 4:2:2 recording (when supported by the codec) provides better quantization, giving a superior representation of the original scene and allowing for more flexibility in post production when adjusting color and balance.<BR><BR>By utilizing efficient ProRes codecs, file sizes are kept in check so you won't need to blow your production budget on extra storage.<BR><BR><BR>Connectivity<BR>Ki Pro's extensive connectivity ensures that you will be able to interface with virtually any gear in your production workflow. The rear panel is packed with connectors which include: SDI input/output, HDMI input/output, component analog input/output, balanced and unbalanced analog audio input/output, LTC input/output as well as LANC.Content<BR><BR><BR>Reliable storage media<BR>Ki Pro captures directly to reliable AJA KiStor media. KiStor media are available as HDDs or SSDs in a variety of capacities to best suit the demands of your production environment. KiStor modules also feature built-in FireWire 800 or USB 3.0 connectivity for direct connection to your editing system using standard interfaces. KiStor media may also be used with the optional KiStor Dock which features a Thunderbolt&trade; connection for lightning-fast data transfers.<BR><BR>Remote configuration and operation<BR>On set or in a machine room, Ki Pro is equipped for advanced remote control and configuration. With a standard Ethernet LAN connection to a host computer and any web browser, all Ki Pro parameter settings, clip selection and transport controls can be controlled; no additional or special software installation is required on the host computer. Multiple Ki Pro units can even be controlled from a single web interface making Ki Pro an ideal solution for multi-camera recordings. Complete developer tools are also available allowing advanced users to script and automate Ki Pro for custom applications.<BR><BR>Familiar controls and operation<BR>Just like a traditional tape deck, Ki Pro features straightforward and dedicated transport buttons - record, play, stop, rewind, fast forward - making the device easy to operate with minimal training time. The current status of the system and key configuration information is clearly displayed on the built-in screen. Additional operational information can be found in the STATUS menu which can be accessed even when recording or playing back.<BR><BR>The Ki Pro operating system offers users a flat menu structure that is easy to navigate with menu parameters presented in clear and understandable language.<BR><BR>Automatic Camera Control<BR>Using the Camera Data menu parameter, record start/stop operation can be trigged automatically with select cameras. Even file names can be reproduced on the Ki Pro to match the camera native recordings. Automated start/stop can also be accomplished via LANC when connected to properly equipped cameras.<BR><BR>Ethernet file transfer<BR>Because of its network connectivity, media can be copied to and from Ki Pro over the Ethernet connection. This allows for fast file transfers without the need to physically remove the media from the Ki Pro, which can be especially useful in larger facilities and can cut down on machine room traffic by eliminating the number of people that have to be in the machine room.<BR>","Video Formats<BR>525i 29.97<BR>625i 25<BR>720P 23.98, 25, 29.97, 50, 59.94, 60 (Note: 720p 23.98 (24), 720p 25 and 720p 29.97 require a valid camera source and the use of the Record Type&gt;VFR selection)<BR>1080i 25, 29.97, 30<BR>1080PsF 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97, 30<BR>1080PsF 23.98, 24, 25*, 29.97* (Note: 25 and 29.97 require a valid camera source and the use of the Record Type&gt;PsF selection)<BR>1080p 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97<BR>Codec Support<BR>Apple ProRes 422<BR>Apple ProRes 422 (HQ)<BR>Apple ProRes 422 (LT)<BR>Apple ProRes 422 (Proxy)<BR>Removable Storage<BR>AJA Ki Stor modules - 1 slot<BR>ExpressCard/34 - 2 slots (Only Slot 1 active, See www.aja.com for supported media)<BR>Video Input Digital<BR>SD/HD SDI, SMPTE-259/292/296, 10-bit<BR>Single Link 4:2:2 (1 x BNC)<BR>HDMI v1.1<BR>Video Input Analog<BR>SD/HD Component (3 x BNC)<BR>SMPTE/EBU N10, Betacam 525 line, Betacam 525J<BR>12-bit A/D, 2x oversampling<BR>+/- .25 dB to 5.5 MHz Y Frequency Response<BR>+/- .25 dB to 2.5 MHz C Frequency Response<BR>.5% 2T pulse response<BR>&lt;2 ns Y/C delay inequity<BR>Video Output Digital<BR>SD/HD SDI, SMPTE-259/292/296, 10-bit<BR>Single Link 4:2:2 (1 x BNC)<BR>HDMI v1.1<BR>Note: HDMI requires 1080i, 720p or 1080p to be active; HDMI does not provide support for PsF<BR>Video Output Analog<BR>Composite (1xBNC)<BR>NTSC, NTSCJ, PAL<BR>12-bit D/A, 8x oversampling<BR>+/- .2 dB to 5.0 MHz Y Frequency Response<BR>+/- .2 dB to 1 MHz C Frequency Response<BR>.5% 2T pulse response<BR>&lt;1% Diff Phase<BR>&lt;1% Diff Gain<BR>Note: Composite output requires that the Component Analog output be set to SD; composite output does not support HD<BR>Component (3 x BNC)<BR>HD: YPbPr, RGB<BR>SD: YPbPr, RGB (component mode)<BR>SMPTE/EBU N10, Betacam 525 line, Betacam 525J, RGB<BR>12-bit D/A, 8x oversampling<BR>+/- .2 dB to 5.5 MHz Y Frequency Response<BR>+/- .2 dB to 2.5 MHz C Frequency Response<BR>.5% 2T pulse response<BR>&lt;1 ns Y/C delay inequity<BR>Audio Input Digital<BR>2-channel or 8-channel user selectable<BR>8-channel, 24-bit SMPTE-259 SDI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR>2-channel, 24-bit HDMI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR>Audio Input Analog<BR>2-channel, 24-bit A/D analog audio, 48kHz sample rate, balanced (2 x XLR)<BR>Input level: Line, Mic, Mic+phantom 48Vdc<BR>+24dbu Full Scale Digital<BR>+/- 0.2db 20 to 20kHz Frequency Response<BR>2-channel unbalanced (2 x RCA)<BR>Audio Output Digital<BR>8-channel, 24-bit SMPTE-259 SDI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR>2-channel, 24-bit HDMI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR>Audio Output Analog<BR>2-channel, 24-bit D/A analog audio, 48kHz sample rate, balanced (2 x XLR)<BR>+24dbu Full Scale Digital (0dbFS)<BR>+/- 0.2db 20 to 20kHz Frequency Response<BR>2-channel unbalanced (2 x RCA)<BR>Stereo unbalanced headphone (1 x 3.5mm mini jack)<BR>Up-Conversion<BR>Hardware 10-bit<BR>Anamorphic: full-screen<BR>Pillar box 4:3: results in a 4:3 image in center of screen with black sidebars<BR>Zoom 14:9: results in a 4:3 image zoomed slightly to fill a 14:9 image with black side bars<BR>Zoom Letterbox: results in image zoomed to fill full screen<BR>Zoom Wide: results in a combination of zoom and horizontal stretch to fill a 16:9 screen; this setting can introduce a small aspect ratio change<BR>Down-conversion<BR>Hardware 10-bit<BR>Anamorphic: full-screen<BR>Letterbox: image is reduced with black top and bottom added to image area with the aspect ratio preserved<BR>Crop: image is cropped to fit new screen size<BR>Cross-conversion<BR>Hardware 10-bit<BR>1080i to 720P<BR>720P to 1080i<BR>Timecode<BR>SDI RP188/SMPTE 12M via SDI BNC<BR>LTC input (1 x BNC)<BR>LTC output (1x BNC) (Note: active during playback not during record or EE)<BR>Network Interface<BR>10/100/1000 Ethernet (RJ-45)<BR>802.11g Wireless<BR>Embedded web server for remote control<BR>Computer Interface<BR>IEEE1394b/FireWire800<BR>User Interface<BR>2 x 20 character display, with dedicated buttons<BR>Control<BR>LANC Loop (2 LANC Connectors) (Note: requires a LANC enabled camera)<BR>Lens Tap (Note: Not activated)<BR>IEEE-1394a/FireWire400 for control and timecode data<BR>Machine Control<BR>RS-422, Sony 9-pin protocol.<BR>9-pin D-connector pinout is as follows:<BR>1&#9;GND<BR>2&#9;RX-<BR>3&#9;TX+<BR>4&#9;GND<BR>5&#9;No Connection<BR>6&#9;GND<BR>7&#9;RX+<BR>8&#9;TX-<BR>9&#9;GND<BR>Shell&#9;GND<BR>Physical<BR>Width: 9.00&quot; (22.86cm)<BR>Depth: 6.12&rdquo; (15.56cm) from front antenna cover to back of handles<BR>Height: 3.25&quot; (8.25cm)<BR>Power: 100-240 VAC 50/60Hz (adapter), 12-18Vdc 4-pin XLR (chassis), 3.3A max, 30W typical<BR>Weight: 3.7 lb.

Ki Pro Mini works equally well whether your gear uses SDI or HDMI.
The SDI and HDMI outputs are always both active, making the Ki Pro
Mini not just a recorder but a useful converter as well. Two XLR analog
mic/line audio inputs allow on set audio to be recorded directly into
the ProRes or DNxHD files, meaning less work in the edit to synchronize
audio and video from separate sources.
Ki Pro Mini vastly extends your on set capabilities. For rapid playback,
recorded shots can be viewed immediately without the need for
separate video assist equipment.
If you’re using a mobile editing system, footage from Ki Pro Mini can be
edited while you’re still on the set, letting you make sure you have the
right shots before moving on.
Once connected to a camera, Ki Pro Mini requires minimal direct user
interaction. With direct support for Canon, Sony and RED camera data,
record start/stop, timecode and clip naming (if available) can be read
from the SDI signal. On properly equipped cameras, LANC control can be
used for start/stop detection as well. Ethernet connectivity of Ki Pro Mini
allows control and configuration to be performed via web browser at
distances up to 100 feet.

Canon USA,Canon 7428B002 EOS C100 with Dual Pixel CMOS AF Feature Upgrade,7428B002,6999,,,"The Canon EOS C100 Digital Video Camera brings together the renowned technology of Canon CMOS sensors, DIGIC DV III Image Processor, and EF lens compatibility in a smaller, lighter body. Modular and compatible with a host of Canon and third-party accessories, the EOS C100 brings true cinema quality to independent event videographers and video production organizations.
The EOS C100 camera with Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology features a CMOS sensor that consists of an array of pixels that each feature two separate photodiodes. By continuously comparing their outputs during AF mode, phase-difference autofocus helps ensure non-blurred images and smooth focus transitions even when the talent and/or camera are moving. The new feature places a high priority on maintaining sharp focus while, providing a natural, smooth autofocus movement with select Canon EF lenses – including newer-generation STM lenses – which offer even smoother and quieter operation.","Canon DIGIC DV III Image Processor<BR>Exceptional Low Light Sensitivity and Wide Dynamic Range<BR>Canon Log Gamma and Wide DR Gamma<BR>Multiple Recording Modes and Frame Rates<BR>Full Manual Control and Focusing Aids<BR>Compact and Ergonomic Design<BR>One-Shot AF and Push Auto Iris<BR>High Resolution EVF and Integrated LCD Display<BR>Removeable Hand Grip with XLR Inputs and Built-in Stereo Microphone<BR>AVCHD File Based Recording to SD Cards<BR>HDMI Out with Time Code<BR>Remote Terminal","Imaging Sensor<BR><BR>Effective Pixels <BR>3840 x 2160 pixels;

The PL 85-300 offers a focal length of 85-218mm at T2.9 and 300mm at T4.0, with 200-degree focus rotation.
Designed using the latest optical simulation technology, the PL 85-300 Cabrio not only offers exceptional optical performance in the center of the image but in the corners of the frame as well. Like the highly acclaimed PL 19-90 Cabrio, the PL 85-300 is equipped with the same indispensable features including flange focal distance adjustment, a MOD of 1.2m, a macro function for objects as close as 97cm (38-inches), and covers a 31.5mm diagonal sensor size.
The digital servo’s 16-bit encoding assures operators that all lens data output—such as the position of the zoom, iris, and focus—is extremely accurate and the lens supports Lens Data System (LDS) and /i metadata formats. Like the PL 19-90 Cabrio, the new PL 85-300 features an exclusive detachable servo drive unit, making it suitable for use as a standard PL lens or as an ENG-style lens. And the PL 85-300 can be controlled using cinema industry standard wireless controllers as well as existing FUJINON wired and wireless units.",,"Camera Format&#9;PL Mount<BR>Focal length&#9;85 - 300 mm<BR>Zoom range&#9;3.5 &times;<BR>Maximum Photometric Aperture T-No.&#9;1 : 2.9 (85-218mm)<BR>1 : 4.0 (300mm)<BR>Iris Blades&#9;9<BR>Focus Rotation (degrees)&#9;200<BR>Zoom Rotation (degrees)&#9;120<BR>M.O.D. from image plane&#9;1.2 m / 4'<BR>Object dimensions at M.O.D.<BR>16 : 9 Aspect ratio*&#9;85 mm   274 &times; 154 mm<BR>300 mm   79 &times; 44 mm<BR>Angular field of view<BR>16 : 9 Aspect ratio*&#9;85 mm   18&deg;21&prime; &times; 10&deg;23&prime;<BR>300 mm   5&deg;14&prime; &times; 2&deg;57&prime;<BR>Macro&#9;Available as standard<BR>Filter thread&#9;M111 (Protection Filter Included)<BR>Diameter &times; Length&#9;114 &times; 249 mm<BR>Weight&#9;3.0 kg with Drive <BR>2.5 kg without Drive<BR>Features&#9;<BR>With Detachable Digital Drive Unit<BR>Flange Focal Distance Adjustment<BR>LDS &amp; /i Compatible<BR>Lens Hood Optional - Accepts M114 Filter<BR>",,1,31,FN-ZK3.5x85,

The unit provides a broad, soft and diffused light. As a cosmetic light source the Diva-Lite 401 is ideal for news presenters reporting from locations around the world. The compact size and rugged lightweight nature make it well suited for travel. 

The Diva-Lite puts out a broad soft wash of light. The drop off is like the light off of a bounce card. For this reason it is most effective in close proximity to the subject. By being close, the light is softer and easily controlled with the built-in barndoors and detachable louvers.
This instrument is proving to be very popular for interviews. It is small enough to travel easily. It is light enough to rig onto lighting stands or onto grip arms. An interview can be done with as little as a single Diva-Lite 401 and a bounce card.

Diva-Lites operate on Kino Flo True Match 55W compact fluorescent lamps. Daylight balanced (KF55) and tungsten balanced (KF32) lamps are available. 

Light level control is established through an onboard dimmer as well as by 2 and 4 lamp switching. 
An in-line power switch controls the power. Louvers provide control over the spread of the light.

Panasonic,"Panasonic H-NS043 42.5mm, f1.2 Lumix G Micro Four Thirds Noticron Lens",H-NS043,1599.99,,,"The name ""NOCTICRON"" was newly defined by Leica Camera AG for this lens that achieves remarkably fast F1.2 aperture. The popular 42.5 mm of middle-telephoto focal distance (Equivalent to 85 mm on a 35 mm camera) is definitely suitable for portrait with rich stereoscopic effect. Together with the high-speed aperture, you can utilize the beautiful soft focus for more impressive, creative shots. 9 blades give the aperture a rounded shape that produces a smooth effect in out-of-focus areas when shooting at larger aperture settings
The inclusion of newly developed stepping motor makes the focusing action smooth and silent for use in both photo and video recording. Notably the performance of AF is by far superior to the phase-difference AF when fast lens with smaller F value is used. When mounted on the cameras of LUMIX G, you can take advantage of the high-precision, high-speed Contrast AF system.
With Panasonic's Nano Surface technology the reflection is dramatically minimized at entire visual light range (380nm-780nm) by applying the extra-low refractive index coating with nano-sized structure on the surface of the lens. It results in the super clear picture with dramatic reduction of ghost and flare.
Due to the shallow depth of field which is unique to the large aperture lens, even a slight handshake causes out-of-focus. However, the POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) which is newly integrated in this lens effectively compensates for not only small, fast movement but also large, slow one making it easy to shoot super clear shots even when shooting in low-lit situations such as in night time or indoors.

Rode,Rode Stereo VideoMic Pro XY stereo condenser microphone with integrated shockmount,Stereo VideoMic Pro,399,,,"Stereo VideoMic Pro provides a high quality stereo option for videographers, and is ideal for recording music, and the atmospheric ambience essential in building a realistic audio scene.

Based around a matched pair of high sensitivity ½”cardioid condenser capsules in a coincident XY pair, the Stereo VideoMic Pro provides a wide stereo image with natural depth.

The Stereo VideoMic Pro builds on the feature set of the VideoMic Pro, with an ergonomic form factor perfectly suited to DSLR, consumer camcorders and large-sensor video cameras. The integrated shock mounting system provides superior isolation from vibration and mechanical noise that can otherwise degrade the recording quality. Additionally the lightweight yet robust multi-strand cable provides excellent acoustic decoupling from the camera and offers significantly lower noise transference than traditional audio cable.

The user friendly designed rear of the microphone body features the power and equalisation controls, including a high pass filter at 75Hz which is designed to cut out the noise generated by air conditioning, traffic and other undesirable low frequency interference.

A -10dB PAD allows the user to reduce the sensitivity of the microphone, making it suitable for recording loud sound sources such as live music or at sporting events.

The Stereo VideoMic Pro features a +20dB level boost specifically designed to provide a higher quality signal with DSLR cameras. When activated, the typically low quality camera preamp level can be reduced, resulting in a lower noise floor and much clearer recording.","Broadcast recording quality on-camera microphone<BR>Matched pair 1&frasl;2&rdquo; condenser capsules in XY stereo configuration<BR>Ultra lightweight, compact form factor<BR>On mic power and EQ controls<BR>Two step High Pass Filter (flat, 75Hz)<BR>Three position level control (-10dB, 0, +20dB)<BR>9V battery powered - over 100 hours use (alkaline)<BR>Integrated shock mounting<BR>Integrated foam windscreen<BR>3.5mm stereo mini-jack output<BR>Billeted metal camera shoe mount with 3/8&rdquo; thread for easy boompole mounting<BR>10 year extended warranty ","Acoustic Principle&#9;Pressure Gradient<BR>Active Electronics&#9;JFET impedance converter<BR>Capsule&#9;0.50&quot;&#9;<BR>Address Type&#9;End<BR>Frequency Range&#9;40Hz - 20kHz<BR>Output Impedance&#9;200&Omega;<BR>Maximum SPL&#9;134dB SPL (@ 1kHz, 1% THD into 1K&Omega; load)<BR>Sensitivity&#9;-38.0dB re 1 Volt/Pascal (12.60mV @ 94 dB SPL) +/- 2 dB @ 1kHz<BR>Equivalent Noise Level (A-weighted)&#9;20dB-A<BR>Power Options&#9;9V<BR>Weight&#9;115.00gm<BR>Dimensions&#9;130.00mmH x 66.00mmW x 108.00mmD<BR>Output&#9;3.5","Rode Stereo VideoMic Pro<BR>Metal Camera Shoe Mount with 3/8&quot; Thread<BR>Windscreen<BR>10 Year Warranty",1,512,RO-Stereo VideoMic Pro,

Including an audiophile quality 18-bit resolution, 48kHz sampling A/D converter, the Podcaster processes all of the analogue-to-digital conversion internally, bypassing the computer's lower quality on-board sound controller altogether.

A headphone output on the microphone body provides zero-latency monitoring, so the user can hear exactly what is being recorded, free of delay or echo.

The Podcaster features an internal pop filter, designed to minimise plosives sounds that can overload the microphone capsule and distort the audio output.

It is fully compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac OS X computers, as well as several Linux distributions. The microphone is bus powered and features a status LED to indicate operation.

The Podcaster is ideal for podcasting, vodcasting, YouTube videos, voice recognition software, corporate videos and any production application that requires a simple yet professional voice-over microphone.

Zacuto,Zacuto Z-RHGK Recoil Handgrip Kit,Z-RHGK,1175,,,"The Recoil Handgrip Kit is comprised of a Zgrip Z-Mount Zwivel handgrip, a Z-Drive follow focus and the Zacuto Tornado grip. This kit is perfect for turning your rig into a Recoil rig. A Recoil rig positions the camera directly on top of the operators shoulder (usually with a QR Shoulder Pad) creating a shorter, more balanced traditional style rig. The Recoil Handgrip Kit pushes focusing forward and down for easy accessibility while also providing double handles for stability. This kit attaches to your existing 15mm rods (lightweight or studio spaced) running through a baseplate. 

The Zacuto Z-Drive is a unique, direct drive universal follow focus. It attaches to a single 15mm diameter rod and curves away from the operator at a 60 degree angle creating space and distance from the lens for comfortable use when the camera is on your shoulder. The Z-Drive slides on to the rod and tightens in place next to your lens with a Zacuto quick-release ratcheting red lever. It comes with a fixed 1 ¾” diameter .8 pitch gear to connect to your lens. If your lenses are not pitched to .8 or are not pitched at all (most DSLR and basic video camera lenses are not) you can add our Zipgear Universal to your lens so the teeth match our gear correctly for smooth rotation. The Z-Drive has a slender marking disc to create distance marks for repeatable focus pulls and a standard whip port. 

The Tornado grip attaches to the Z-Drive whip port and works in tandem with the Z-Drive to create a unique mechanical follow focus handgrip. Slide the Tornado grip into the Z-Drive whip port by pushing down on the round plunger and pushing the Tornado into the port. Once you release this plunger it will be securely attached. Grab the horn handle with your bottom three fingers, placing your forefinger and thumb on the scalloped focus wheel. Turn your whole hand to focus. For lenses with a large focus rotation, release your thumb and forefinger, ratchet your wrist back and grab the scalloped wheel once again for more range. 

The Zgrip Z-Mount Zwivel comes with a black 4.5 inch rod and a Z-Mount Zwivel 2 to attach to any 15mm rod. The Zwivel 2 allows you to change the angle between the two 15mm rods at set points turning 365 degrees using a pin locking mechanism. The Zwivel 2 has two levers which control each 15mm hole. In order to change the angle of the rods, just loosen either of the levers and the internal spring separates the parts for you to adjust to the desired angle. The handgrip fully articulates at a ball joint via the red quick release lever.

The anti-fog is extremely important for reducing fog. It does not have a diopter but will include the Zacuto Z-Finder Extender Frames.

Zacuto,Zacuto Z-CRLV2 Recoil V2 for Canon C100-C300-C500,Z-CRLV2,800,,,"The Recoil V2 is the ultimate balanced rig for the Canon C100/300/500. In the Recoil concept, the camera sits directly on your shoulder like a typical ENG camera. The Recoil V2 is super light and stripped down (if you are looking for something even more stripped down, check out the Recoil Lite V2). The Recoil V2 starts with our Studio Baseplate. It attaches to the camera with 3/8” 16 and ¼” 20 screws. There are 12” lightweight spaced 15mm threaded rods running through the Studio Baseplate. These can be extended to hold additional accessories at the front or back of the kit. They can slide back and forth through the plate to accommodate different lens lengths by loosening the two levers on the side of the plate. The Studio Baseplate also features lightweight spaced rod holes on either side of the plate. They accept a female rod end (or Zacuto Zamerican articulating arm) and tighten with an Allen. When sitting on a tripod, you can mount a Zwiss Plate V2 from the rod ports on the side of the baseplate (via two short female/female rods, not included) for better balance. 

Unique to the Recoil system is the use of the Zacuto QR Shoulder Pad. The QR Shoulder Pad is a completely universal curved, padded shoulder pad system. The shoulder pad is designed to sit directly under your camera or baseplate putting the camera on top of your shoulder. The QR Shoulder Pad is a two part system that includes the shoulder pad itself and a separate dovetail plate that screws into the bottom of your camera or baseplate just like an ordinary tripod plate. The shoulder pad is set at an angle and made of form-fitting Akton Polymer pad to settle comfortably into your shoulder. The dovetail plate comes with one (1) ¼ 20 and one (1) 3/8 16 screw in sliding tracks that allows you to position the plate at any point under your baseplate for comfort and balance. The QR Shoulder Pad attaches, positions, and detaches from the dovetail plate with a quick release lever. The dovetail plate can act as a traditional tripod plate and snap directly into a tripod, monopod, slider or other standard piece of equipment.* 

The Recoil also includes our ENG Grip Relocator that positions the C100/300** removable grip at the rods for comfort and convenience. The Canon C100/300 removable grip attaches directly to our Relocator handle and our exclusive right angle cable connects to the port on your camera. Once its plugged in, users have trigger or on/off control, lens aperture control, and a programmable function button that can be set to a number of things including waveform, 1 to 1 zoom, zebras, my menu, and many more. The cable is 24"" long. 
The Recoil V2 is a great kit for run & gun style or all day shooting with the Canon EOS C100/C300/C500. It is an extremely versatile kit.

This Z-Finder will magnify the LCD screen by 1.8x and has a diopter wheel for specific focus tuning. It cuts out any extraneous light and offers an initial point of stability by pressing your eye against the large eyecup. The Z-Finder includes 4 interchangeable anti-fog glass diopters, 0, +1, +2, and +3 so you can correct it to your vision right out of the box and then fine tune it with our red adjust wheel for perfect clarity. -1 and +4 diopters are available for purchase separately. An aluminum sun mask is built in to the Z-Finder to protect your LCD screen from sunlight.

The C300/C500 Z-Finder is attaches by using a foam padded sleeve that slides over the LCD screen of either the C300 or C500. The sleeve is secured into place with a bar clamp. It also includes a unique monitor lock clip to keep the LCD screen from moving forward when the Z-Finder is pressed against your eye. 

The Mounting Kit for the C300/C500 Z-Finder allows you to position the LCD screen forward and off the the side in a position to better enable shoulder mounted shooting.

Zacuto,Zacuto Z-DRV Z-Drive,Z-DRV,550,,,"The Zacuto Z-Drive is a unique, universal direct drive follow focus, designed with single operator shoulder mounted rigs in mind. Because it has a universal joint and no internal gears it can’t develop play. It attaches to a single 15mm diameter rod and curves away from the operator at a 60 degree angle creating space and distance from the lens for comfortable use when the camera is on your shoulder. This is the perfect follow focus for a Recoil kit set up (where the camera is directly over your shoulder) as it brings focus control further forward as well as down for comfortable operation. The Z-Drive can operate in four modes and is extremely adjustable for all size lenses. It can operate on the camera assistant or operators side of the rig positioned forward toward the lens or backward towards the tripod/dolly etc.. This makes for easy operation with a standard follow focus whip used on a tripod. 

The Z-Drive slides onto a single 15mm diameter rod (on the left or right of your camera) and tightens in place next to your lens with a Zacuto quick-release ratcheting red lever. It comes with a fixed 1 ¾” diameter .8 pitch gear to connect to your lens.

Sony Electronics Inc,Sony PXWZ100 4K Handheld XDCAM Memory Camcorder,PXWZ100,5699,,,"Previously the exclusive domain of feature films and high-end production, 4K is now available for corporate video, event video, education and houses of worship. Because now Sony introduces the PXW-Z100, the one-piece handheld camcorder that makes the phenomenal imagery of 4K available to anyone, anywhere, for any application. With the PXW-Z100 you can shoot incredibly rich, superbly robust 1080p HD, then switch over to 4K (4096 x 2160) or 4K TV-friendly Quad Full HD (3840 x 2160) whenever you need them. Choose frame rates from 24p to 60p. Because the camera uses the same XAVC™ Intra 4:2:2 codec as Sony’s high-end F55, your pictures are superb. Because the ergonomics are based on Sony’s popular handheld camcorders, the operation is friendly and familiar. And because the camera captures 4K, it’s ready for whatever you’re shooting today—and tomorrow.","4K 60p in a handheld camera With the PXW-Z100, high resolution and high sensitivity go hand in hand. The 1/2.3&rdquo; sensor boasts 8.8 million effective pixels, while back-illuminated Exmor&reg; R CMOS technology delivers impressive low-light performance. The sophisticated optics of Sony&rsquo;s 4K-rated G Lens provides a generous 20x zoom, plus a versatile 30mm wide angle (4K mode, 35mm full frame equivalent).<BR>Sony&rsquo;s amazing XAVC codec The PXW-Z100 boasts the same high-end XAVC&trade; Intra codec as the F55 digital motion picture camera. You get the power of 4:2:2 color, the dynamic expression of 10-bit recording and the accuracy of all-I-frame encoding, which compresses each frame individually. Based on industry-standard AVC/H.264 compression, XAVC recording is already compatible with leading dailies, editing and color correction tools. You get 4K, QFHD or HD at frame rates from 24p to 60p. The maximum 4K bit rate is 600 Mbps (60p) while the top HD bit rate is 223 Mbps (50/60p).<BR>Advanced XQD memory cards Keeping up with the impressive data rates of XAVC 4K recording takes some equally impressive memory. The PXW-Z100 features two slots for XQD&trade; memory cards, which have been standardized by the CompactFlash Association. The system takes advantage of the familiar PCI Express interface and a Sony developed controller to support stable recording at up to 600 Mbps. For best performance, we recommend S Series QD-S32E and QD-S64E cards.<BR>Upgrade path to XAVC LongGOP For extended recording time, Sony plans to offer XAVC LongGOP and the popular AVCHD&trade; codec as a firmware update planned for the middle of 2014. AVCHD files are particularly well suited to the Blu-ray Disc&reg; playback environment.<BR>Relay recording For extended shoots, the PXW-Z100 provides relay recording between the two card slots. You can begin a recording session on one card, then automatically switch to another&mdash;and even replace the first card and switch back! Maximum session duration is 13 hours. (With current NLEs, spanned clips cannot be combined. Depending on NLE, audio may be discontinuous at the breaks.)<BR>High-quality audio Two XLR connectors support professional microphones such as the Sony ECM-680S and wireless microphone systems such as the UWP-V1. Use the built-in stereo microphone or the use the external XLR inputs to record two channels of 24-bit 48kHz audio.<BR>Time code input/output A true professional, the PXW-Z100 provides time code input and output, vital to multi-camera productions.<BR>Wi-Fi remote control For operating flexibility, you can control record start/stop, focus, zoom and aperture from a smartphone browser.<BR>Creative paint functions The PXW-Z100 affords exceptional creative control with adjustable gamma curve, black level, skin detail, color and more. You can even save these parameters to a memory card as a camera profile. Then use your profile on another PXW-Z100 for precise matching in multi-camera setups.<BR>Powerful focus assist Because focus is especially critical on 4K content, Sony provides auto focus and one-touch auto focus, plus powerful support for manual focus, including color peaking and focus magnifier.<BR>60Hz and 50Hz system switchable<BR>Optional 3 or 5 year Extended Warranty available","Built-in Optical Filters&#9;CLEAR<BR>1/4 (2 Stops)<BR>1/16 (4 Stops)<BR>1/64 (6 Stops)<BR>Gain&#9;0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 dB AGC<BR>Imaging Device&#9;1-chip 1/2.3&quot;-type back-illuminated &quot;Exmor R&quot; CMOS Sensor<BR>Minimum Illumination&#9;60P : 4lux(1/30 Shutter Speed)<BR>50P : 3lux(1/25 Shutter Speed)<BR>Shutter Speed (Time)&#9;Auto/Manual selectable, 1/3 sec to 1/9,000 sec<BR>Slow &amp; Quick Motion Function&#9;1080p: 1.2.4.8.15.30,60 fps (60Hz mode)<BR>1080p: 1.2.3.6.12.25,50 fps (50Hz mode)<BR>Slow Shutter&#9;1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30 sec.

Manfrotto,Manfrotto 504HD 504HD Pro Fluid Video Head 75mm half ball,504HD,520,,,"The 504HD is Manfrotto's latest video fluid head. It is a perfect balance of design and performance. The bridge design improves the head's rigidity and its PAN friction control is fast, simple to fine-tune and protected from knocks.
All structural components are made from aluminum, with the PAN axis rotation unit using ball bearings to obtain smooth, totally vibration-free controlled movements that can be directly adjusted using the head's FDS variable friction system. FDS on both the PAN and TILT axes also ensures that the head works perfectly at all temperatures, with all types of equipment and under all loads.
Ergonomically improved lever and dial designs combine with the new friction index to give you complete control over the 504HD.
The 504HD has been designed to offer a load capacity of up to 7.5kg (16.5lb) making it suitable for a huge range of camera equipment. The CBS counterbalance system has 4 presets for a full range of camera weights (0.2.5kg-5.5lb, 5kg-11lb and 7.5kg-16.5lb).
Leveling the head is easy thanks to the 75mm diameter hemisphere and the back-lit bubble level. Two 3/8” threads on the top plate allow accessories (such as monitors and arms) to be directly and securely attached to the head, which helps cut down set-up time, keeps your camera hot shoe free and, saves you from using another clamp.
High rigidity structure delivers maximum response and strength. Ergonomic controls for easy use in all conditions. Easy-link connections for accessories. 4-step counterbalance system ensures a quick set-up with optimal balance. Ball Bearing drag system for precise, smooth movements.

It’s compact size and rugged lightweight nature make them well suited for travel. 

The Diva-Lite puts out a broad soft wash of light. The drop off is like the light off of a bounce card. 
For this reason it is most effective in close proximity to the subject. By being close, the light is softer and easily controlled with the built-in barndoors and detachable louvers.
This instrument is proving to be very popular for interviews. It is small enough to travel easily. It is light enough to rig onto lighting stands or onto grip arms. 
Diva-Lites operate on Kino Flo True Match 55W compact fluorescent lamps. Daylight balanced (KF55) and tungsten balanced (KF32) lamps are available.

Glidecam Industries,Glidecam Industries GLX10 GLIDECAM X-10,GLX10,2399,,,"The GLIDECAM X-10 is a highly advanced, professional Body-Mounted Camera Stabilization System designed to be used with specific Glidecam Hand-held Camera Stabilizers**. The GLIDECAM X-10 system will allow you to walk, run, go up and down stairs, shoot from moving vehicles and travel over uneven terrain without any camera instability or shake.
The GLIDECAM X-10 is very similar in design to the Glidecam Smooth Shooter; however the X-10 comes with both sections of its support arm being able to move vertically, whereas the Smooth Shooter comes with only the front section of its support arm being able to move vertically. Also, the X-10 comes with a trimmable Arm-to-Vest Connector, whereas the Smooth Shooter’s Arm-to-Vest Connector is not trimmable.
The GLIDECAM X-10 system works by isolating your body's motion from your camera, while your camera is balanced in a relatively motionless and isolated state. The GLIDECAM X-10'S Support Arm can be boomed up and down, as well as pivoted in and out, and side-to-side. It is the combined booming and pivoting action of the Support Arm that isolates your motions from the camera in a way that creates smooth camera footage.","38 Precision Radial Bearings in Support Arm<BR>Inter-X-Change<BR>Trimmable Arm-to-Vest Connector<BR>Spring Loaded Support Arms Carry all the Weight<BR>Run, walk, go up and down stairs, or shoot out of a car, there will be no instability or shaking<BR>","The Support Arm can be setup and configured so either a left-handed, or a right-handed operator can use the system.<BR>Dual Support Arm Boom Range: 30&quot;<BR>Dual Support Arm Weight: 5 pounds 12 ounces in Two Spring Mode, without arm posts.<BR>Individual Weight Plates: each 12.9oz (366 grams)","Glidecam X-10 Support Arm<BR>Glidecam Support Vest<BR>Docking Bracket<BR>(1) Stainless Steel Arm Post<BR>(1) Aluminum Arm Post<BR>(6) Steel Weight Plates<BR>Hardware and Operations Manual",1,184,GLD-GLX10,
Glidecam Industries,Glidecam Industries GLHD4 GLIDECAM HD-4000,GLHD4,649,,,"With the Glidecam HD-Series hand-held Stabilizers your camcorder seems to float, always balanced, isolated from your hands undesirable motions. Now you are free to move with your camera - panning, tilting, booming or running without any camera instability or shake.
The Glidecam HD-Series works so well that it allows you to shoot incredibly smooth and graceful shots even while going to extremes like running up and down stairs or traveling over rugged terrain. And when it comes to normal shooting, like walking or moving the camera slowly around someone, the results are equally magical. 
Each HD-Series Stabilizer’s offset, foam cushioned, Handle Grip is attached to a free floating, three axis Gimbal.  This allows your hand to move up and down, and side-to-side, thereby isolating your hand’s unwanted motions from the camera. This up and down movement alleviates the bouncing, pogo type action often associated with our competitor’s system because their handle cannot move up and down.  This design feature, coupled with the overall higher inertia of the  HD-Series systems, produces superior stabilization when compared with our competition.
A unique and proprietary, precision, three-axis Gimbal incorporates several adjustable, axis convergence controls.  This allows all three axes to intersect for proper operational alignment.
A camera-mounting platform with a quick-release, no-tools, drop-on camera plate allows you to quickly attach or remove your camera.  Ergonomic, control knobs allow quick, precise adjustment of the top stage’s back and forth, and side-to-side movement.  These controls allow you to adjust the camera’s horizontal balance.

Canon USA,Canon 5260B002 EOS 5D Mark III Kit,5260B002,4200,,,"Canon is proud to present the highly anticipated EOS 5D Mark III. With supercharged EOS performance and stunning full frame, high-resolution image capture, the EOS 5D Mark III is designed to perform. Special optical technologies like the 61-Point High Density Reticular AF and an extended ISO range of 100–25600 (expandable to 50 (L), 51200 (H1) and 102400 (H2) make the EOS 5D Mark III ideal for shooting weddings in the studio or out in the field, and great for still photography. Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes. Additional technological advancements include an Intelligent Viewfinder, Canon's advanced iFCL metering system, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Multiple Exposure mode-all of which help make the EOS 5D Mark III the perfect multimedia tool.  

In response to user requests, Canon has released a firmware update that expands the versatility and functionality of the EOS 5D Mark III. This update enables the camera to export clean, uncompressed HDMI output to an external recorder, while still being able to record to internal CF or SD cards and monitor the video on the rear LCD display. In addition, this update improves autofocus performance by allowing cross-type support at f/8 (center point)","Newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor, 14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L:50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) for shooting from bright to dim light and next generation DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and exceptional processing speed.<BR>New 61-Point High Density Reticular AF including up to 41 cross-type AF points with f/4.0 lens support and 5 dual diagonal AF points (sensitive to f/2.8) and cross-type AF support at f/8 (center point)*.<BR>iFCL Metering with 63 zone dual-layer metering sensor that utilizes AF and color information for optimizing exposure and image quality.<BR>EOS HD Video with manual exposure control and multiple frame rates (1080: 30p (29.97) / 24p (23.976) / 25p, 720: 60p (59.94) / 50p, 480: 30p (29.97) / 25p with 4 GB automatic file partitioning (continuous recording time 29 minutes 59 seconds), selectable &quot;All i-frame&quot; or IPB compressions, embedded timecode, manual audio level control while recording, headphone terminal and uncompressed HDMI output*.<BR>Outstanding shooting performance: up to 6.0 fps continuous shooting using a UDMA CF card.<BR>Magnesium-alloy body with shutter durability tested up to 150,000 cycles, enhanced dust-and-weather resistance, and updated EOS Integrated Cleaning system for improved vibration-based dust removal.<BR>Intelligent Viewfinder with superimposed LCD display with approximately 100% field of view, wide viewing angle of 34.1&deg;, and 0.71x magnification.<BR>3.2-inch Clear View II LCD monitor, 170&deg; viewing angle, 1,040,000-dot VGA, reflection resistance with multi coating and high-transparency materials for bright and clear viewing.<BR>High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Multiple Exposure modes expand creative possibilities.<BR>Improved handling with the addition of new customizable controls, enhanced recording options with Dual Card Slots for CF and SD cards, Dual Axis Electronic Level, and compatibility with optional Canon Wireless File Transmitter and GPS Receiver.","Type <BR>Digital, AF/AE single-lens reflex, camera<BR><BR>Recording Media <BR>CF Cards (Type I); Compatible with UDMA CF cards; SD, SDHC, and SDXC Memory Cards<BR><BR>Image Format <BR>Approx. 36 mm x 24mm (35mm Full-frame)<BR><BR>Compatible Lenses <BR>Canon EF Lenses (excluding EF-S Lenses)<BR><BR>Lens Mount <BR>Canon EF mount<BR><BR>Image Sensor<BR><BR>Type <BR>High-sensitivity, high-resolution, large single-plate CMOS sensor<BR><BR>Pixels <BR>Effective pixels: Approx. 22.3 megapixels<BR><BR>Pixel Unit <BR>6.25 &micro;m square<BR><BR>Total Pixels <BR>Total pixels: 23.4 megapixels<BR><BR>Aspect Ratio <BR>3:2 (Horizontal: Vertical)<BR><BR>Color Filter System <BR>RGB primary color filters<BR><BR>Low Pass Filter <BR>Fixed position in front of the image sensor<BR><BR>Dust Deletion Feature <BR>(1)&#9;Self Cleaning Sensor Unit<BR><BR>&middot;Automatic Sensor Cleaning<BR><BR>&middot;Removes dust adhering to the infrared- and ultraviolet-blocking glass.<BR><BR>&middot;Self-cleaning executed automatically when power is turned on or off.

ABOUT THIS LENS
The HJ40x10B and the companion HJ40x14B are a high definition EFP lens family that brings entirely new shooting flexibilities to field production. The HJ40x10B can extend to 770mm with the extender while the HJ40x14B can achieve an unprecedented 1120mm. Both lenses represent the very best in optical and mechanical design and their unique optical image stabilization systems make possible the capture of rock steady high definition imagery under the most adverse of field conditions. 

They represent an excellent marriage of needs for creative flexibility and mobility in a handheld HDTV camera system with the demanding performance requirements for high-end HDTV image acquisition at long focal lengths. The design optimization strategies included a dual lens approach to broaden the shooting options, achievement of an adequate sensitivity, maximization of image contrast, and preservation of the highest MTF over the long focal ranges. 

High contrast is ensured by superb control of black reproduction – with optical and mechanical design innovations that substantially reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections. Similar attention to minimization of ghost images and other highlight-related chromatic distortions caused by strong light sources on-axis and off-axis further extend the operational contrast range of the lens.

It is a smaller and lighter replacement for the former highly popular HJ21ex7.8B lens. It is a strategic member of the family of HD portable EFP lenses – that collectively offers an unusually broad range of creative options.

This particular lens is intended for producers and broadcasters having as their foremost priority the ability to shoot over long distances combined with wide angle capture in a lightweight (4.0 lbs) mobile production lens system having exceptional HDTV performance. The optional flexibility of Canon’s Crossover aspect ratio switching system makes it a superb performer for both 16:9 widescreen and standard 4:3 image formats.

ABOUT THIS LENS

The HJ22ex7.6B mobilized the best in portable EFP optical design criteria to achieve a remarkable lens offering focal lengths up to 168mm (or 336mm with extender) and a wide-angle of 64.6 degrees horizontal (for the 16:9 aspect ratio). Combined with an exceptionally high sensitivity (F1.8 maximum aperture) this is a lens that can encompass an unusually broad range of shooting situations.

The design optimization strategies sought a high and balanced MTF profile over the entire image plane at an approximate F4.0 aperture setting that is well-maintained even when the lens aperture is wide open. Relative light distribution was optimized for F2.8 and above and this uniformity of brightness across the image plane combines with the high contrast and excellent picture sharpness to produce vividly clear HD pictures. Contrast was extended by superb control of black reproduction – with optical and mechanical design innovations that substantially reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections.

Canon USA,Canon KJ17ex7.7B IRSE,KJ17ex7.7B IRSE,16500,,,"The KJ17ex7.7B is the first of a new family of second generation 2/3-inch HDgc portable HD lenses. The new design reflects design refinements to the first generation line of HDgc lenses originally introduced in 2006.

The HDgc line of lenses had been specifically developed to achieve a price performance ratio that was commensurate with the new line of cost-effective HD camcorders being introduced by all major camera manufacturers in response to the broadcast industry’s rapidly growing interest in transitioning to HDTV newsgathering, HD reality shows, and other lower-budget HD productions. They also directly address the increasing adoption of HD digital origination by the growing independent filmmaking market sector.  In addition, they are anticipated to foster growing interest in HD within the broad B2B market sectors. To support this extensive flexibility in HD acquisition systems, the HDgc family includes 2/3-inch, 1/2-inch, and 1/3-inch lenses.

The KJ17ex7.7B is a portable HDTV production lens within the 2/3-inch image format sector of the new HDgc family. This particular lens is intended for users whose foremost priority is an affordable HD lens that delivers a generous range of focal lengths combined with a wide field of view in a lightweight mobile package. It was specifically designed for the many new cost-effective but remarkably high-performance 2/3-inch acquisition systems that appeared in 2008-2009.

In the KJ17ex7.7B lens imaging performance has been significantly advanced by mobilizing the most contemporary of optical glasses, optical coating materials and processes, and powerful new optical design tools.  Customer feedback also spurred a total redesign of the digital drive unit that further optimized both the ergonomic aspects and the performance of the digital electronic control of zoom, iris, and focus.

The short 7.7 mm focal length translates to a 63.9 degree horizontal angle of view for the 16:9 HD image format.  Combined with a focal range that has been extended to now cover a range from 7.7mm to 131mm (and 262mm with extender) this lens offers unsurpassed operational capabilities in a compact package weighing less than 3.5lbs. Focus breathing has also been significantly reduced over the predecessor lens.  

ABOUT THIS LENS
The KJ17ex7.7B represents a new degree of optimization in meeting the demands for mobility in a handheld HDTV camera system and achieving the imaging quality sought in HDTV broadcast news acquisition while also essentially maintaining the price level of the original HDgc.  The maximum relative aperture is F1.9 which, combined with the typically F-10/11 sensitivity specifications of the contemporary HD ENG cameras, ensures excellent video pictures in very low light environments.  The image performance strategies of this new lens sought a tighter control of MTF across the entire image plane and with operational variations of zoom, iris, and focus.  Minimization of monochromatic and chromatic aberrations and further maximization of image contrast combine with the improved MTF to produce superb picture sharpness. 

Relative light distribution over the mid to long focal lengths is better controlled and this better uniformity of brightness across the image plane combines with the higher contrast and higher MTF to produce sharp clear HD pictures.  Contrast was enhanced by excellent control of black reproduction using new multilayer anti-reflective optical coatings and new optomechanical design innovations that significantly reduced flare, veiling glare, and any internal reflections.
  
The lens spectral transmittance characteristic was closely coordinated with that of all of the major portable HD cameras to ensure adherence to the international HDTV colorimetric standard.

The SDI output can be used to feed professional monitors or recording gear, while the HDMI output is able to feed directly into consumer HDMI monitors. Both HDMI and SDI are active at all times, so you can simultaneously work with professional and consumer gear. 3D support enables T-TAP to output directly to 3D HDMI monitors for real time stereoscopic review, with no need for additional hardware. Even with its small size, T-TAP doesn’t compromise on professional audio functionality. Full 8-channel embedded audio allows for multi-channel playback such as 5.1 - or even 7.1 mixes. T-TAP is powered via Thunderbolt with no need for an additional power supply, minimizing cabling and maximizing portability.","Thunderbolt Connection <BR>10-bit SD, HD and 2K Output <BR>HDMI Output to 3D HDMI Monitors<BR>HD/SD SDI and HDMI outputs<BR>24-Bit 8-Channel Embedded Audio","Video Formats<BR>525i 29.97<BR>625i 25<BR>720P 50, 59.94, 60<BR>1080i 25, 29.97, 30<BR>1080PsF 23.98, 24<BR>1080p 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97, 30<BR>2K (4:2:2)<BR>2048 x 1080PsF 23.98, 24<BR>Video Output Digital<BR>HD/SD-SDI, SMPTE-259/292/296<BR>Single Link 4:2:2 (1 x 3G BNC)<BR>HDMI v1.3 30 bits/pixel, RGB or YUV, 2.25 Gbps, SD, HD<BR>Audio Output Digital<BR>8-channel, 24-bit SMPTE-259 SDI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR>8-channel, 24-bit HDMI embedded audio, 48kHz sample rate, Synchronous<BR><BR>Physical<BR>Width: 2.95&quot; (7.5cm)<BR>Depth: 1.18&quot; (3cm)<BR>Height: 2.28&quot; (5.8cm)<BR>Power: 5V Thunderbolt Bus powered; 6.5W peak<BR>Interface: Thunderbolt (Single port)","AJA T-TAP",1,2,AJA-T-TAP,
"Aja Video Systems, Inc.",AJA FS2 Dual Channel Universal 3G/HD/SD Audio/Video Frame Sync/Converter,FS2,4995,,,"Offering huge flexibility and the power to adapt to meet the needs of rapidly changing environments, FS2 offers unprecedented conversion and frame synchronization power in a 1RU space. Capable of simultaneously working with two independent streams of 3G/HD/SD 10-bit broadcast-quality video and two independent groups of multi-channel analog or digital audio, each FS2 video channel supports virtually any input or output: analog component or composite, 3G/HD/SD-SDI, Dual Link (1.485 Gb), Fiber and HDMI I/O. A Fiber I/O option allows fiber cable runs of up to 10 kilometers to be connected directly to the FS2 without the need for separate fiber to SDI conversion. Each video processing channel can be individually cropped and resized using AJA’s image scaling technology for the best possible
quality when incorporating non-standard image sizes. FS2 can be used as two separate Frame Synchronizers/Format Converters, or the two channels can be linked with the internal FS2 keyer to do the work of three or more devices - for example HD sidebar keying where both the video and background graphics are up converted and combined. FS2 can up or down convert between SD, HD, and 3G HD (1080p50/60), and cross convert between HD formats including 3G HD. Additionally, FS2 has full input and output signal routing, allowing any I/O port to be assigned to either processing channel.
For audio, FS2 has two audio processors, each supporting 16-channel AES/EBU digital audio, 16-channel embedded audio, and 8-channel balanced analog audio with a variety of controls for maximum flexibility. The output of each processor can be embedded in its respective video processor output (SDI, Fiber, or HDMI), or sent to the AES or balanced outputs. For 3G and Dual Link inputs, the audio processors can have access to all 32 channels. FS2 supports closed captioning and the conversion of closed captioning between SD and HD formats - including full conversion between CEA-608 and CEA-708 caption standards.

Sony Electronics Inc,Sony PXWX200 XDCAM XAVC HD422 hand-held camcorder,PXWX200,7790,,,"The PXW-X200 incorporates an improved 1/2inch-type Exmor 3CMOS sensor for high sensitivity and low noise image, and XAVC Intra/Long GOP recording with 4:2:2 10-bit sampling as well as MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps MPEG HD 420 35 Mbps, MPEG IMX and DV. As the successor of PMW-200, the PXW-X200 has many new and unique features, including newly developed 17x Fujinon professional HD zoom lens with three independent rings with end stops, able to zoom from 29.3mm to 499mm (35mm equivalent), dual SxS memory card slots for simultaneous recordings*, relay recording, cache recordings, and Slow & Quick function. The PXW-X200 also has a built-in wireless network operation capability that offers remote control, file transfer, monitoring via smartphones and tablet devices, and live streaming","Newly developed three 1/2&quot;-type Exmor&trade; CMOS Full HD sensors&#9;The PXW-X200 incorporates three 1/2&quot;-type Full-HD Exmor CMOS sensors to achieve high resolution, high sensitivity, low noise, and wide dynamic range. With these image sensors, the PXW-X200 achieves a high sensitivity of F12 at 1080/59.94i and F13 at 1080/50i - essential levels for professionals shooting under challenging lighting conditions.<BR>17x optical zoom lens with three independent rings with end-stops&#9;The PXW-X200 is equipped with a 17x optical zoom lens able to zoom from 29.3mm to 499mm (35mm equivalent). It has three independent control rings with end-stops, which allows manual control of focus, zoom and iris, making for better and faster adjustment. The 8 pin lens remote connector is located on the lens grip, which enables to use third party controlers such as Libec, VariZoom, and Bebbob.<BR>High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Log GOP recordings&#9;The PXW-X200 supports not only MPEG HD422 50Mbps in MXF (Material eXchange Format), which is widely accepted by major broadcasters worldwide, but also XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP codecs. XAVC technology is based on the H.264 standard, which provides an exceptional performance compression technology. XAVC Intra (frame) compression means that every frame is encoded independent of the other frames - providing a better quality picture, without compromises. With a Long GOP codec, only certain frames are encoded individually. This allows the codec to squeeze the video into a much smaller bitrate than Intra technology. The main benefit is faster ingest and editing. XAVC Long GOP files also require less storage space than XAVC Intra files, providing budget savings on recording media. The XAVC codec adopts 4:2:2 10-bit sampling for high definition recording with rich grading expression.<BR>Dual SxS media slots for Simultaneous*/Relay recording&#9;The PXW-X200 is equipped with two SxS memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with SxS PRO+, SxS-1 memory cards, and also SDXC** and SDHC** cards can be used with the adapter MEAD-SD02, and XQD** card with QDA-EX1. Two media slots can record in either &quot;Simultaneous&quot; or &quot;Relay&quot; mode. &quot;Simultaneous&quot; mode* permits recording the same content to two memory cards at the same time, while &quot;Relay&quot; mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. <BR><BR>* &quot;Simultaneous&quot; recording mode requires free future firmware upgrade. <BR>** Some selected recording mode and salvage feature are not supported.<BR>Wireless file transfer and live streaming from the field*&#9;Users can simply attach the supplied Wireless LAN module to activate the wireless function on the PXW-X200. And by connecting with separately sold internet routers, proxy or high-resolution files can be transferred to a cloud server, and the editing process can be started while location shooting continues. The PXW-X200 also has a streaming capability. By attaching a separately sold LTE USB module*, live video and audio can be streamed, watched, and recorded at a remote location. <BR><BR>* A free future firmware version upgrade is required to activate this function.<BR>Near Field Communication* (NFC) function with Content Browser Mobile&#9;A Near Field Communication (NFC) function allows easy, one-touch wireless LAN connection to a smartphone or tablet device without manual setting of the network parameters. A Content Browser Mobile** application enables users to monitor the currently shot video and to wirelessly control camcorder settings such as focus, zoom, iris, white balance, REC START/STOP, and more. <BR><BR>* NFC allows close-range wireless communication between the PXW-X200 and an NFC-equipped smartphone or tablet device. <BR>** This application can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or App Store.<BR>Proxy recording on SD card&#9;The PXW-X200 can record proxy video H.264 on an SD card. The resolution and bitrate of proxy video can be changed for a more flexible workflow. The proxy files are recorded in MP4 format for better compatibility with broadcast systems. The lightweight proxy video files are generated separately from the main line recording and recorded to SD cards for quick sharing of content over low-bandwidth mobile networks. <BR><BR>Video: AVC/H.264 Main Profile, 4:2:0, MP4 <BR>Audio: AAC-LC, 2ch, 48KHz, 128kbps<BR>Wide choice of connections&#9;The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including single 3G HD-SDI, HDMI, USB, composite output, timecode input/output and genlock input. The 3G HD-SDI connector is able to output the 1080/59.94P or 50P signal. Down-conversion output from HD to SD is also possible. The i.LINK connector can be used for HDV when SP 1440 (FAT) mode is selected and for DV when DVCAM (FAT) mode is selected. Simultaneous output from both SDI and HDMI is possible. The Rec Trigger signal can be sent through SDI and HDMI to link an external recording device.<BR>Multi Interface Shoe* (MI Shoe) for flexible connection&#9;The PXW-X200 is equipped with a Multi Interface Shoe (MI Shoe) that has an electric interface in its mechanical attachment allowing the camcorder to communicate with an attached accessory. Accessories attached to the MI Shoe can be controlled by the camcorder. Using an MI Shoe connection with sold separate optional adapter SMAD-P3, the audio signal from a UWP-D series wireless microphone package can be input from the wireless microphone receiver to the PXW-X200 without an XLR cable. The power can be supplied from the PXW-X200 to the receiver and a battery is not required for the receiver operation. When the battery is attached to the LED video light HVL-LBPC, the light can be switched on and off from the camcorder which syncs with recording trigger. <BR><BR>* A free future firmware version upgrade is required to activate hot shoe function.<BR>Timecode and Genlock&#9;The PXW-X200 is equipped with timecode input/output (selectable) and genlock input interfaces. These interfaces are useful when shooting with multiple camcorders. The video signal timing and the timecode can be synchronized among the camcorders, and this helps when assembling video clips from multiple camcorders in the editing process.<BR>Catalyst &quot;Browse&quot; software from Sony&#9;The new software Catalyst &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; is a free clip management tool for both PC &amp; Mac that supports Sony professional formats. Review footage on location, add metadata and review color corrections. Paid upgrade option is available to the advanced Catalyst &quot;Prepare&quot; media preparation tool.

The sensor has 14.2 million effective pixels enhancing shooting under severe lighting conditions and providing more freedom of creative expression.<BR>High sensitivity and high resolution&#9;Thanks to the 1.0&quot; type Exmor R CMOS sensor, the PXW-X70 has high sensitivity 1.67 stops brighter than a 1/2.88&quot; type sensor. The camcorder also has higher resolution than any other camcorder in its price range. The 1.0&quot; type sensor is brighter and offers more background defocus with a shallow depth of field than 1/3&quot; type or 1/4.7&quot; type sensors.<BR>Compact body&#9;The palm-sized PXW-X70 is ergonomically designed to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use experience.<BR>ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens with lens ring&#9;The PXW-X70 is supplied with a fixed 29 mm wide-angle ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens. Ideal for capturing grand landscapes, it also provides up to 12x optical zoom. It also has one lens ring which enables smooth, natural adjustment of focusing or zooming, depending on which mode is selected.<BR>Clear Image Zoom&#9;The 12x optical zoom can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom, maintaining full resolution using Super Resolution Technology. In addition, the Digital Extender can double this range again, up to 48x zoom. Super Resolution Technology is a Sony original intelligent interpolation which analyzes the input image and increases the resolution of the image.<BR>Manual controls&#9;The manual dial and buttons on the side of the body allow swift and easy adjustment of IRIS (aperture), GAIN/ISO and shutter speed.<BR>ND filter control mechanism&#9;The PXW-X70 is equipped with multipule ND Filter selections, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions from 1/4ND, 1/16 to 1/64ND.<BR>Wi-Fi/NFC (Near Field Communication) with Content Browser Mobile, and Video/Audio Streaming for future upgrade&#9;The PXW-X70 can be remotely controlled from a smartphone or tablet computer (iOS 4.3 through 7.0 or Android 2.3 through 4.3) via a Wi-Fi connection, and recorded video files can be transferred from camcorder to smartphone in MP4 format.* In addition to file transfer, streaming via 4G/LTE is planned to be available by firmware upgrade in the future. One-touch authentication is also possible with smartphones that offer NFC connectivity.

The shape supports long periods of camera use and flexibly accommodates subtle differences among various users' gripping styles. The angle of the grip can be easily adjusted with the press of a button. In addition to a zoom button and Rec Start/Stop, the grip also has several programmable buttons that can be customized for easy access to any other functions such as the expanded focus function. The length of the arm section of the PXW-FS7 can be adjusted just by turning a knob. Another knob at the joint makes it easy to adjust the angle of the camera. So a user can choose a comfortable style that suits his or her physique and shooting position.<BR>Easy settings during one-man operation<BR>The Peaking and Zebra function buttons and contrast knob are positioned on the side of the PXW-FS7 viewfinder for easy adjustment of focus, contrast and exposure. Also, by turning a single knob, the position of the finder can be set, allowing for degrees of freedom. The viewfinder system is designed that even people with a dominant left eye can use it comfortably.<BR>Dust-proof, drip-proof design for use even in harsh environments<BR>The body of the PXW-FS7 is constructed to withstand tough conditions, with buttons, dials and other parts specially sealed to prevent dust and water spray from entering. Also, the air passageways from the cooling fan are separated from the interior of the camera.<BR>Built-in Multi-Interface (MI) Shoe<BR>The PXW-FS7 is equipped with a Multi-Interface (MI) Shoe that supports connection to wireless microphone packages such as the UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 (sold separately). When connected to the shoe, the HVL-LBPC light (optional) can be turned on or off from the camera, and power and audio connections are provided to the UWP-D11 or UWP-D12 without cables.<BR>Equipped with high-sensitivity 4K Super 35mm Exmor CMOS sensor<BR>The PXW-FS7 is equipped with a Super 35mm CMOS image sensor with approximately 11.6 million total pixels (4352 x 2662) and 8.9 million effective pixels. The high image readout speed of the image sensor allows the PXW-FS7 to support 4K motion-picture shooting and Super Slow Motion. The sensor also realizes a high sensitivity of ISO2000 and a wide dynamic range of 14 stops. Thanks to its full-pixel readout capability without pixel binning and sophisticated camera processing, jaggies and moire. are minimized.<BR>Internal recording in 4K resolution up to 60fps<BR>The PXW-FS7 supports internal recording at 4K resolution as well as a wide range of frame rates (59.94P, 50P, 29.97P, 25P and 23.98P). When viewed on a 4K monitor, footage shot in 4K is reproduced so clearly down to the finest details that it gives a viewer the illusion of actually being within the scene. When viewed on a Full HD monitor, 4K footage boasts even higher resolution than footage shot in Full HD.<BR>Super Slow Motion continuous recording is possible<BR>The PXW-FS7 offers continuous recording at Full HD image quality and a frame rate of up to 180 fps. This makes it possible to attain up to 7.5x Super Slow Motion when played back at 23.98 fps. Furthermore, support for unlimited shooting at Super Slow Motion means no more mistimed shots leading to extra takes. It also lets you pick out footage at exactly the point that you want.<BR>&alpha; Mount System for a wide selection of lenses and E-mount that is suitable for movie shooting<BR>The PXW-FS7 incorporates the &alpha; Mount System, with an E-mount lens mount. This is especially useful for motion-picture shooting because the system supports power driven silent auto focus, iris control, power zoom and more, as well as SteadyShot image stabilization and other functions. Moreover, the E-mount system's short flange-back distance (the distance from the lens-mounting surface to the image sensor) enables use of A-mount lenses via LA-EA4 lens adaptor, as well as various other lenses via third-party adaptors. The E-mount system thereby makes it possible to take advantage of a wealth of lens resources suitable for creative, versatile video expression.<BR>Supports various formats, including XAVC Intra and Long GOP<BR>The PXW-FS7 supports two formats, XAVC and MPEG-2 HD 422, which can be selected to suit the application. Two XAVC compression systems (Intra and Long GOP) are provided through an H.264AVC codec. Intra supports recording with 4:2:2 10-bit sampling for 4K and Full HD, as well as a high bit rate of up to 600 Mbps. In Long GOP, image quality and recording time are balanced to allow Full HD recording in 1080/50P with 4:2:2 10-bit sampling at only 50 Mbps, making this format suitable for longer duration shooting. Support is also provided for the MPEG2 HD 422 recording format, which is mainly used at broadcast stations. Supported formats and bit rates are indicated below.<BR>Support for S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3, SGamut3/S-Log3 and other log curves<BR>The PXW-FS7 supports such log gamma curves as S-Gamut3. Cine/S-Log3 and S-Gamut3/S-Log3. Due to the fact that 18% grey is set at a bright level, S-Log3 is noted for delivering a wider dynamic range than the 1300% achieved by S-log2 incorporated in cameras such as the NEX-FS700, a difference equal to 1.5 stops. The log gamma itself is close to Cineon log, so colour correction is easier to perform and it is possible to achieve cinematic expression with the look of film. In addition, compared to the colour gamut of S-Gamut3. Cine, which is geared toward reproducing the wide colour gamut of DCI-P3 colour space used in digital cinema, the colour gamut of S-Gamut3 is geared toward the reproduction of almost all actual colours, and is thereby suitable for archival purposes.<BR>Extension Unit XDCA-FS7 for shooting support<BR>Extension Unit XDCA-FS7 can be connected directly to the PXW-FS7K to enable the use of functions that support the operator's shooting style or workflow, including Apple ProRes 422 recording to an XQD card in the camera.<BR>Built-in ND filter unit<BR>ND filters for adjusting the amount of light are provided in a built-in ND filter unit. This allows shooting to be done with a shallow depth of field without having to stop down the iris, even under bright conditions. The settings are Clear, 1/4 (2eV), 1/16 (4eV) and 1/64 (6eV).<BR>Two XQD media slots support simultaneous and relay recording<BR>The PXW-FS7 has two XQD card slots that enable simultaneous and relay recording. During relay recording, when one medium becomes full, recording continues automatically to the other media. During simultaneous recording, not only can the same footage be recorded on both channels at the same time, but also one channel can be used for random shooting while the other is being used for continuous recording as backup.<BR>RAW output for external 4K/2K RAW recording*<BR>The FXW-FS7&rsquo;s FS RAW Interface that can be connected to an HXR-IFR5 interface unit and RAW AXS-R5 recorder to enable external 4K/2K RAW recording.

The extra-large pixels on the &alpha;7S collects dramatically more light than traditional cameras to produce beautifully detailed, low-noise images in even the most challenging lighting environments.<BR>12.2MP sensor optimized for 4k and low light video&#9;The &alpha;7S is the world&rsquo;s first 35mm camera to incorporate &lsquo;direct pixel readout&rsquo; utilizing the entire width of the full-frame image sensor without line skipping or pixel binning. Therefore in both HD and 4K video acquisition I can read and process data from every one of the sensor&rsquo;s pixels. This allows video shooters to utilize all of the artistic and creative benefits provided by the unique sensor.<BR>Fast Intelligent AF in light as low as EV -4&#9;Equipped with the same high-precision Fast Intelligent AF system as the &alpha;7R camera, the &alpha;7S drastically improve AF sensitivity in low-light that can go as low as -4EV.<BR>New-generation RGB filter with gapless on-chip lens design&#9;The larger than normal pixel size on the 35mm full-frame image sensor with effective 12.2MP, employs Sony&rsquo;s latest image sensor technologies on the &alpha;7S. To boost the image sensor&rsquo;s light collection efficiency, a new-generation RGB color filter has been adopted, in addition to the gapless on-chip lens design, light concentration technology and photodiode expansion technology delivers unprecedented high sensitivity and low-noise levels with high dynamic range in every light condition from severe low light to bright sunlight. By applying an AR coating on the surface of the seal glass over the image sensor, ghosting and flare&#12288;have been minimized, further contributing to the &alpha;7S&rsquo;s high image quality.<BR>Uncompressed 4:2:2 Full HD and 4K QFHD output via HDMI1&#9;In video mode, the &alpha;7S can output 4K video at QFHD (3840x2160) in 4:2:2 to an optional external 3rd party 4K recorder via the HDMI1<BR>50Mbps XAVC S 1920x1080 at 60P, 1280x720 at 120P&#9;For the first time ever in a Sony &alpha; camera, the &alpha;7S adopts the workflow-friendly XAVC S recording format in addition to AVCHD and MP4 codecs. XAVC S format allows for full HD recording at a data rate of 50 mbps with lower compression for improved video quality. The &alpha;7S can record full HD (1920x1080) at frame rates of 60p, 60i, 30p and 24p directly to a compatible memory card. Video modes can be changed from full-frame to APS-C (super 35mm equivalent) if desired, and in this crop mode, the camera can support high frame rate 120fps shooting at standard HD resolution (1280 x 720p), creating a 5x slow-motion effect.<BR>Pro-workflow w/ Picture Profile, S-Log2 and time code&#9;The &alpha;7S is equipped with S-Log2 gamma. Common to Sony&rsquo;s range of professional video cameras, S-Log2 expands the dynamic range by up to 1300% to minimize clipped highlights and loss of detail in shadows.

"FUJIFILM Optical Devices U.S.A., Inc.",FUJIFILM ZK2.5x14 PL 14-35 Cabrio Lens,ZK2.5x14,42000,,,"Designed using the latest proprietary optical simulation software, the PL 14-35 mm wide angle lens offers exceptional optical performance in the center of the image and in the corners of the frame. The digital servo’s 16-bit encoding assures operators that all lens data output—including the position of the zoom, iris, and focus—is extremely accurate. The PL 14-35mm lens supports Lens Data System (LDS) and /i metadata formats, and can be controlled using cinema industry standard wireless controllers as well as existing FUJINON wired and wireless units.
The PL 14-35mm Cabrio lens has a detachable digital servo drive. The Cabrio can be used as a self-contained ENG-style lens or cine style lens. Cinematographers will also be right at home with this lens. With the detachable drive removed, the lens is set to accept industry standard cine motors and matte boxes. The 14-35mm lens is lightweight and comfortable to use with today’s smaller 4K cameras. For shooters looking for a lightweight zoom that can be used as a handheld, capturing wide angles in tight spaces, it’s ideal.
The PL 14-35 covers 31.5mm sensor size on a digital cinema style camera. While sensors on standard broadcast cameras are all the same size, sensors on digital cine cameras vary greatly. This new zoom ensures the image captured will cover large sensors for optimal, full-frame resolution. A nine-blade iris part of the design as well, creating the most natural-looking imagery possible.","With Detachable Digital Drive Unit<BR>Flange Focal Distance Adjustment<BR>LDS &amp; /i Compatible<BR>Lens Hood Optional - Accepts M114 Filter<BR>","Camera Format&#9;PL Mount<BR>Focal length&#9;14 - 35 mm<BR>Zoom range&#9;2.5 &times;<BR>Maximum Photometric Aperture T-No.&#9;1 : 2.9<BR>Iris Blades&#9;9<BR>Focus Rotation (degrees)&#9;200<BR>Zoom Rotation (degrees)&#9;120<BR>M.O.D. from image plane&#9;0.6 m / 2'<BR>Object dimensions at M.O.D.<BR>16 : 9 Aspect ratio*&#9;14 mm   701 &times; 394 mm<BR>35 mm   193 &times; 109 mm<BR>Angular field of view<BR>16 : 9 Aspect ratio*&#9;14 mm   88&deg;52&prime; &times; 57&deg;45&prime;<BR>35 mm   42&deg;49&prime; &times; 24&deg;53&prime;<BR>Macro&#9;Available<BR>Filter thread&#9;M111 (Protection Filter Included)<BR>Diameter &times; Length&#9;114 &times; 231 mm<BR>Weight&#9;2.9 kg","Fujinon ZK2.5x14 14-35mm T2.9 Cabrio PL Lens <BR>Protection Filter<BR>Limited 2-Year Warranty on Parts and Labor",1,31,FN-ZK2.5x14,

The camcorder gives broadcasters a high degree of flexibility, allowing you to shoot in a wide variety of HD and SD formats, including XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP, MPEG SStP 422 Lite (HDCAM SR), MPEG HD 422 and MPEG HD 420, as well as MPEG IMX and DVCAM. Options allow the camcorder to record directly in Avid DNxHD and Apple ProRes, offering direct compatibility with NLEs. The camcorder also has a host of leading professional features, such as Slow & Quick Motion up to 30 fps for MPEG HD 422 (as standard) and up to 120 fps for XAVC (as an option), wireless operation, picture cache recording, built-in GPS, Digital Extender, variable ND filter control, HyperGamma, and many more. A wide range of connectors, including 3G/HD/SD-SDI, HDMI and USB, increase the flexibility further.","New CCD Imager&#9;The PXW-X500 is equipped with three 2/3-inch type Full HD CCD sensors. Based on the latest on-chip lens structure, this type of CCD offers a high sensitivity of F11 at 60i (F12 at 50i) and improved S/N ratio of 60 dB (with NS on). The camcorder also offers minimum illumination of 0.016 lx (typical) in 1080/59.94i mode +42 dB gain, with 16-frame accumulation.<BR>High quality XAVC Intra and XAVC Log GOP recordings&#9;The PXW-X500 supports not only MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps in MXF (Material eXchange Format), which is widely accepted by major broadcasters worldwide, but also XAVC Intra and XAVC Long GOP codecs. XAVC technology is based on the H.264 standard, which provides an exceptional performance compression technology. XAVC Intra (frame) compression means that every frame is encoded independent of the other frames &ndash; providing a better quality picture, without compromises. With a Long GOP codec, only certain frames are encoded individually. This allows the codec to squeeze the video into a much smaller bitrate than Intra technology. The main benefit is faster ingest and editing. XAVC Long GOP files also require less storage space than XAVC Intra files, providing budget savings on recording media. The XAVC codec adopts 10 bit sampling for high definition recording with rich tonal expression. The bit rate of XAVC recording is 111 or 112 Mbps at 1080/59.94i or 50i and 89, or 112 Mbps at 1080/23.98P or 25p. The high bit rate gives a better quality picture.<BR>Switchable recordings for greater flexibility&#9;As well as shooting at XAVC HD, MPEG HD 422 50 Mbps and MPEG HD 420 35 Mbps, the camcorder also supports MPEG SStP 422 Lite (HDCAM SR), as well as SD MPEG IMX and DVCAM at 25 Mbps in MXF file format. MPEG HD 422 gives a high quality image with more detailed color reproduction, as well as being ideal for chromakeying. MPEG SStP is offered at 1080 59.94i, 50i, 29.97p, 23.98p and 25p. High-quality MPEG HD422 50 Mbps is fully compliant with the latest EBU recommendations for long-form broadcast production and is widely accepted in broadcasting stations and production houses. This recording capability makes the PXW-X500 ideal for a wide range of different applications, including newsgathering and documentary production.<BR>Open workflows with Avid DNxHD&reg; codec and Apple ProRes 422 codec recording options&#9;Sony understands a fundamental truth: working cameras require practical workflows that provide open standards.

It offers approx. 5x slow motion at 23.98p, 4.5x slow motion at 25p and 4x slow motion at 29.97p. In MPEG HD 422 codec, the camcorder offers as a standard feature the ability to capture from 1 fps to 30 fps in 1080p mode, in increments of 1 fps. (frame rates are selectable up to 30 fps in 1080p mode.) * Slow &amp; Quick Motion function for XAVC is available as option PXWK-503.<BR>Dual SxS media slots, &ldquo;Simul&rdquo; or &ldquo;Relay&rdquo; recording, and independent record control&#9;The PXW-X500 is equipped with two SxS memory card slots. The camcorder is compatible with SxS PRO+ and SxS-1 memory cards, XQD, SDXC and SDHC cards can be also used with an appropriate card adaptor. Two media slots can record in either &ldquo;Simul&rdquo; or &ldquo;Relay&rdquo; mode. &ldquo;Simul&rdquo; mode permits simultaneous recording to two memory cards, while &ldquo;Relay&rdquo; mode automatically switches recording from the first to the second memory card when the first is full. The user can set up the two Start/Stop buttons on the PXW-X500, one on the grip and one on the camcorder body, to independently start and stop recording on different memory cards while recording in Simul mode.<BR>Wide choice of connections&#9;The camcorder offers numerous connections to suit the broadcast workflow, including 3G HD-SDI, HDMI&reg;, USB, composite output, timecode input/output and genlock input.

Canon USA,Canon 0635C002 EOS C300 MK II Digital Cinema Camera,0635C002,20000,,,"The EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera is an evolutionary 2nd generation Cinema EOS 4K camera system with a wide range of new and improved features including 4K/2K/Full HD internal and external recording (including 4K RAW output) and a new 10-bit Canon Log 2 Gamma. This powerful new camera also features an expanded dynamic range of 15 stops, improved Dual Pixel CMOS Autofocus, innovative focus assist engineering and CFast recording technology. Redesigned with the help of user input, the EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera helps to deliver more creative flexibility for professional studio motion picture production applications, as well as independent productions, TV dramas, commercials, news features, sports and more. 

The EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera integrates a re-designed imaging system of advanced components. These include a newly developed 8.85 Megapixel Canon Super 35mm 16:9 CMOS image sensor that supports up to 4K (DCI) recording with a maximum resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels and a high-speed readout for reduced rolling-shutter distortion. Working in concert with its dual Canon DIGIC DV5 image processors, data from the 4K sensor delivers Over-Sampling HD Processing for reduced-moiré 2K(DCI)/Full 1080-60p HD recording and Dual-Pixel CMOS Auto Focus with an expanded focusing area and Face Detection (in combination with Canon EF lenses). The dual DIGIC DV5 image processors also help to reduce visual noise and enable high-sensitivity shooting at a maximum speed of ISO 102,400 (+54dB) for sharp, clear image capture using only ambient lighting. In addition to its sensor and processors, the EOS C300 Mark II camera also incorporates a trio of XF-AVC H.264 codecs that enable in-camera 4K (DCI) recording to dual CFast card slots and 2K/Full HD recording to an SD card slot. For external recording and monitoring, twin 3G-SDI outputs capable of 4K RAW output are included on the rear of the camera body Users can choose among multiple recording modes, resolutions and frame rates to meet their production needs. 

Creative flexibility is also greatly enabled by the EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera’s compatibility with the full range of more than 100 Canon EF and EF-S photographic lenses (including specialty tilt-shift and fisheye models) and Canon CN-E Cinema prime and zoom lenses (including the ""ENG-style"" Canon CINE-SERVO zooms). New Dual-Pixel CMOS AF capabilities of the EOS C300 Mark II are enabled by the AF motors in Canon EF lenses. The improved EF lens communication capabilities of the EOS C300 Mark II camera allow for the display of CN-E Cinema lens T-values, lens metadata acquisition, and chromatic aberration correction on the camera’s LCD Monitor/EVF/Output display. 

Operability improvements of the Canon EOS C300 Mark II Digital Cinema Camera that further facilitate operation and creative freedom include full manual control, an Ultra-High Resolution 1.77 Megapixel color OLED EVF with adjustable 60º tilting angle, a built in internal mono reference microphone, a removable hand grip, an improved camera handle extension with additional attachment points, and a removable LCD Monitor and control panel with XLR inputs.

Package includes a lavalier microphone, bodypack transmitter and tuner module. Channels 30 to 33. The UWP-X7 includes extremely robust metal construction, mic/line input selection on the bodypack transmitter and a uni-directional lav microphone. ","PLL Synthesized System&#9;Achieves stable transmission and reception by using a UHF PLL (Phase Locked Loop) frequency synthesized system, which provides accurate carrier signal frequencies. This system is used in both the transmitters and tuners, so that a stable carrier is generated at the transmitter, and accurately tuned in at the tuner. This PLL-controlled system provides highly stable, user-selectable frequencies in increments of 125 kHz.<BR>Space Diversity Reception System&#9;Typically, wireless microphone transmission systems can be subject to reception interruptions (signal dropout), but UWP series tuners reduce this to a minimum. By utilizing a space-diversity reception system, it achieves stable reception by using dual-antenna inputs/reception circuits. These receive signals over two different paths and automatically select the stronger RF signal for output.<BR>Tone Squelch Circuitry&#9;To avoid picking up carrier signals transmitted from other systems, the transmitter transmits a 32 kHz pilot-tone signal along with the audio signal. The tuner's squelch circuit recognizes this tone signal, and outputs the audio signal only when this tone signal is received. This function prevents the output of unwanted signals and noise from other signal transmissions in the air, as well as the RF noise and popping noise that occur when the transmitter is powered on or off.<BR>Simultaneous Multi-Channel Operation&#9;Simultaneous operation of up to 16 wireless microphones. Optimum combinations of practically tested, interference-free frequencies are stored in the tuner. By using the pre-programmed frequency groups, users can easily choose interference-free frequencies for the transmitters and tuners, simplifying the task of system setup.","Frequency Range&#9;566 MH to 590 MHz (TV channels 30 to 33) Users may choose from 188 frequencies on each model<BR>Occupied RF Bandwidth&#9;24 MHz<BR>Compatibility&#9;For use with UWP Series wireless products operating on the same frequencies",,1,1,SON-UWPX7/3032,

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year before we go to NAB a few of us decided to note what we're looking for or are interested in and post it as a Pre-NAB Top Ten List.

This way, after NAB, we can compare the list to what we saw and what (if anything) took us by surprise.

<strong>Here are the Top Ten things that I will be in search of:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>3D rigs - large and (hopefully) small</li>
	<li>3D cameras - fully integrated or at least thoughtfully designed</li>
	<li>Wireless logging solutions for various file based cameras</li>
	<li>Archive and restore systems integrated with Asset Management Software (but for smaller post operations)</li>
	<li>Super fast H.264 encoding with production in mind</li>
	<li>Software that makes me say "I wonder if John Rule has seen this yet?"</li>
	<li>Kiki Stockhammer ... kidding!</li>
	<li>Digital SLR cameras that behave more like digital cinema or video cameras</li>
	<li>People walking around head-down with their brand new iPads bumping into each other</li>
	<li>Small wireless transmitters for HDMI or HD-SDI</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Apple iPad For Our Industry, 1st Thoughts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the Apple iPad came out this week and I decided to pick one up Saturday morning.  The line was huge with approximately 180 people who had reservations and another 200+ without.  I was first in line as I had some big plans for the iPad in regards to work.  I talked with many people in line who were planning to use the iPad for social media and games.   A few people saw the iPad as a powerful presentation tool that was compact and easy to tote around on sales visits, etc.   My intention for it was to showcase its potential as a film and video tool both on set and off.  The first thing I did when I got the iPad was to load it up with every camera manual I would use on a gig -- the Panasonic Varicam 2700, RED One, Sony F23, Panavision Genesis, Canon 5D MKII, various recorders/decks, Nano Flash, AJA, monitors, etc.  Then I bookmarked all my favorite websites, forums, blogs, etc.  After that, I added the standard apps for film and video --  iSee4k, Light calc, timecodecal, etc.  I hope the majority of the apps become iPad native as you currently  have to use a 2x zoom on iPhone/Touch apps to fill the screen.  Native iPad apps look amazing and make you want to wait for the others to be released properly.  After adjusting to the iPad it really makes you second guess using the iPhone or iTouch as the smaller size now feels too small. I had convinced myself the iPhone was plenty good enough for the apps I was using.  My iPhone is ironically now used as a phone.  Go figure!

The other great thing about the iPad for us in film, video and photography is its movie and photo playback capability.  To have a thin, lightweight player to showcase demo reels, short films, commercial work, spots and topicals is really a game changer.  The response from clients when you pulled out your iPhone and played them some rough cuts was always viewed as high-speed and resourceful.  Now with the iPad you can really look serious and cutting edge.  No more holding a Touch a foot away from a client's face to show them RED One Aerial shots.  I am a Steadicam Op and primarily shoot b camera in addition to still photography and pickups so I have never really needed a website. The ability to carry around  shots and stills on a nice-sized player while visiting a client is a huge asset, especially for photographers, as the iPad will show RAW images.  A portfolio in hand, mixed with all the other great tools makes the iPad a very good investment.  I ended up with a 32GB model as I have thousands of photographs, steadicam shots, technical manuals, etc., which makes it a good buy without questioning the need to upgrade in a month.

Physically, the iPad is the perfect size to showcase your still/video work.  If you're thinking of purchasing one you will definitely want to get the iPad case as the metal backing is slippery and makes it prone to dropping.  The other negative is that the screen is very glossy and, unlike E-Ink, is difficult to see in bright sunlight.  You will want to order an anti-glare screen protector, which makes it usable outdoors in direct sunlight.  The battery life of the iPad is phenomenal and exceeded all my expectations.  I have not needed to charge it in two days. Those two days of use coupled with watching 45 minutes of a Netflix movie and I am still at 50% battery life. This suggests it's safe to bring on road trips or flights without needing a charger.

Things to consider if you are on the business-end of the industry with the need to give presentations or showcase your work on a projector, etc., is the VGA adapter and the iWork apps.  iWork comes as three separate apps for iPad:  Pages, Keynote and Numbers.   Each is worth the $9.99 price tag if you normally use the apps on your mac.  Other apps to consider are Bento (perfect for cataloging your stock footage or equipment for insurance purposes), GoodReader (for keeping PDF, DOC, and other docs on your iPad), etc.    Native iPad Apps, so far, are limited to a few hundred with more being added every day.

If you're thinking of getting an iPad, it's good to think about your goals for its use.  Essentially, it's a large iPod touch, and if you're visually-challenged or simply need a larger screen, this will make it well worth the price.   If you're in the visual arts (photography, film/video) it's worth the price as long as you leverage it beyond the novelty aspects.  If you're in sales or make presentations to individuals or small groups, or if you are a tech and need to carry around manuals and other troubleshooting documents, the iPad, again, makes sense.  Outside of that, the iPad is just really well-designed and a cool device in general.  I carry mine everywhere and almost every conversation about it has ended with a smile and  the comment, "I need one of those".  If you look at the iPad as a tool, its value becomes more apparent each day with every use.

This blog entry was written on my iPad without the need for a Bluetooth keyboard.  Enjoy your new iPad and look beyond the games and social network apps to really take advantage of how it can work for you and your visual portfolio.

		<title>I am getting SERIOUSLY excited about Alexa!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am going to go out on a limb here and say that Arri's new Alexa Digital Cinema camera is going to be my "Top Pick" of NAB 2010. I've watched with growing excitement as details about the camera's abilities have emerged, such as it's Super-35 CMOS sensor, it's speed (EI 800), it's upgradeability (electronics) and it's versatility (changeable lens mounts). But now we hear some really exciting news, which is that the camera will record internally to SxS memory cards! Not only that, but the format used will be Apple's ProRes! This codec, in 422 (HQ) and 4444 varieties, is good enough to master on for most projects, and then for really high-end work, you can use the ArriRAW signal or the dual HD-SDI connectors (1.5G Dual-link or (2) 3G signals) to record uncompressed on a data recorder like the Codex. In those cases, you could use the ProRes as your offline material, and conform later to the uncompressed material.
<div>I definitely recommend becoming a Fan on Arri's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/ARRI/75451039060?ref=ts">Facebook page</a> to keep up to date on the latest info. There's a nice article <a href="http://www.fdtimes.com/news/?p=1699">here</a>, too.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sony is displaying a new small OLED monitor this year at NAB.

<a href="http://rule-blog.brattleconsultinggroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/85649885.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-122" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/85649885-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>

It is a 10bit panel, incredibly bright outdoors with a 1,000,000:1 Contrast Ratio.
Native resolution of 960x540, so a bit under what we are used to.
3G SDI, HDMI &amp; Composite Inputs!

Seeing OLED production monitors actually come to the live market has been a long time coming.
Hopefully OLED tech, with the ability to produce incredible contrast in less than ideal lighting conditions, will someday replace our LCD Production Monitors, and match the performance of our good 'old CRTs.

Expected on the streets for around $3,000.00

		<title>Steadicam Zephyr: The perfect support solution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a Steadicam operator for over a decade, rigs in the past 5 years have been either too small (in lift capacity) or overkill.  The  Steadicam Zephyr is a great addition to the lineup. All the cameras we're accustomed to using in the commercial world have become more compact and lightweight.   Ten to fifteen years ago our Steadicam rigs were used for cameras in the 12-to-75-lb. range (Master Series Elite Film).  There was no need for lighter-weight rigs  as there were no professional film/video cameras under 12 lbs. With the plethora of high-quality HD cameras in the 5-to-18 lb. range (EX3, HPX170, HPX2700, RED One) and great lightweight film cameras (Arri 235 + 416, Aaton a-minima + Xtera), new stabilization rigs and support systems were required to fill the professional gap.  How many times have I seen someone floating a Sony EX3 or Canon 5DMKII on a Steadicam Archer2 ?  Too many!  And I have done it myself. It's overkill, which is why the Zephyr fills a void.  You might say,  "those cameras are fairly light, why not just use a Pilot?"    In the professional work arena, there has been a demand for more and more accessories in order to make these cameras operate in specific ways. As cameras get smaller and more compact, the need for external accessories to "build them up" has increased. Follow focus units, lens adapters, DOF adapters, DA's, wireless video transmitters, base plates, rods, sunshades, filters, dual batteries, on-board DVR units, etc., all add weight to the camera.  This puts the lightweight Sony EX1R, Panasonic HPX170, and Canon 5DMKII past the abilities of the Pilot rig and into Flyer LE and Zephyr weight range. To me, the Zephyr is a large improvement over the Flyer LE/SE.  At first glance, you might not see the added benefits of the Zephyr so here is what makes it different:

The Zephyr Arm:
The Zephyr arm has a 30 lb. lift capacity. That covers 10 lbs. for the sled with batts, and 20 lbs. for the camera and its AKS.  This is a nominal jump over the Flyer LE but here is why the extra few pounds are key:  The Flyer LE would float a RED One with a prime lens and a clip-on sunshade, the CF module, carbon fiber rods and a Bartech or Fox FF unit.  This was okay, but if you wanted more lift you would need to add some thick rubber bands to the arm to achieve the extra weight in order to avoid bottoming out (while also maintaining a floating point in the arm).  The Zephyr takes care of this by adding a new arm with 30" of boom and a few extra pounds of range.  Now you can float that F900 with a heavier zoom or add that WEVI HD you need. This also means lower and higher boom ranges. The Zephyr arm also adds removable posts just like the Archer2 and higher-end rigs.  This is one of the problems I've faced with the Flyer LE (which is still a great rig).  Need more height? Just add a longer post.  Need to get lower? Add a longer post and use an F or J bracket to get an extra 3-6 inches lower.

The Vest:
The Zephyr vest is a Flyer LE vest.  It has removable pads and it's also comfortable and lightweight.  If this is your first experience with the Flyer LE vest, you'll probably find it to be the most comfortable vest to wear.  It's super-light, which is great for long takes and all-day gigs.  Having used most rigs out there, and while commiserating with other operators, we've all voiced the same "wish" -- that this vest was invented 10 years ago!  Much can be said of the Zephyr as there were only large rigs for cameras 15-to-75 lbs.
<p style="text-align: left;">The Sled:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Zephyr sled is deceiving in that it looks like the Pilot.  It's streamlined and it makes balancing (inertial and dynamic) much easier than the Pilot or the Flyer.  A new dual axis vernier adjustable stage made of aluminum with dovetail makes for quick camera removal and setup. I am not sure if the stage is indexed, but it seems the rest of the rig is indexed, so it seems like a good possibility.  The monitor mount is now indexed for rotation and tilt which is key to keeping the sled in dynamic balance. The new post is made of carbon fiber and and is telescopic with index marks as well (this allows for easily repeatable lower and higher camera flying adjustments).  With all the new indexing, this adds high appeal to the rig for pro and am operators.  Another major improvement to the sled is the multiple power outputs (standard Lemo 3 pin) and an SD and HD BNC inputs and outputs (no need to run extra video cables anymore).  The Zephyr has a second battery mount option that is sure to be a winner with most, as you can stay rigged-up for longer and you can power more accessories.  I noticed that they added an accessory dovetail to the base as well which will save you from having to modify the sled. Also, several ¼-20 mounting holes have been added to the base of the rig which you can use for trim weights or mounting accessories. These little additions are actually huge benefits for a Steadicam (or other brand of) stabilizer.  Often we would modify our rigs to get similar features to make it work with our operating style and requirements.  Now don't get me wrong... I can see myself modifying the Zephyr in a few ways (monitor wise, etc.), but it certainly makes it easier when the provisions for doing so are in place before rather than after the fact.</p>
The features that were maintained from the Flyer LE like the 12V/24V, Anton Bauer or V-lock battery compatibile and no tools post-clamp, will reassure us that no details were cut in order to include new ones. The other main benefit to the new sled is that it features Steadicam TANGO compatibility (read my blog entry on the TANGO).

Overall impressions:
I am really impressed with the Zephyr, and I think Tiffen put a lot of thought and feedback from professional operators into its creation.  I'm not really sure if the Zephyr is a replacement for the Flyer LE and Pilot, but it certainly positions itself that way.  It has the versatility to float lightweight-to-heavier cameras, whereas in the past, we might have bought or rented the Pilot for lighter duty and the Flyer LE for the mid-range cameras.  Having owned a Steadicam Master Elite and used the Ultra, Archer 2, 312, the Artemis HD, and other rigs, the Zephyr looks like the next big rig that even Ultra owners will consider for a running rig or for ENG camera use.   I would have to test the Zephyr for use with HDSLR's (as that is the biggest deal in operating lately) to see if it's overkill or not.  HDSLR use is where a heavily modified Pilot shines.  It looks like the Zephyr was put out to address the RED Epic as it is such a modular rig and fits the weight requirements with full blown AKS to a T.  The professional features of the Zephyr make it a serious contender for anyone torn between the Archer2 and the Flyer LE as it has the best of both worlds.  Pricing has not been posted yet but I have a feeling it will fall closer to the Flyer LE/SE edition than it would to the Archer2.
If you are considering becoming a Steadicam operator, already have a rig, or occasionally use camera stabilizers, give us a call as we are a Steadicam dealer.

		<title>Steadicam TANGO: A natural progression</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=145</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Probably one the most unexpected NAB announcements this year was from Tiffen for the Steadicam TANGO.  Now the TANGO is an idea that I think almost every Steadicam operator I know of has toyed with in the past (at least in principal).  The idea is simple, a lightweight jib arm which is gimbal mounted to a Steadicam arm.  However the TANGO one ups this idea by also transmitting pan, tilt and roll moves to the end of the boom to the slave sled (which holds the camera).  The basic idea of just a jib arm never really got off the ground and I can't think of anyone who even attempted to make it.  Adding the mechanics of pan, tilt and roll were not even a part of the equation in any conversation I had. Steadicam has done just this with the announcement of the TANGO. Not only did they pull it off but they did a remarkable job and did not skip on the length.  Although we have all toyed with the idea in the past of a mobile jib (Polecam has done a pretty great job in that arena) Steadicam has kept it at a usable/reasonable length (9 feet of range). I really think this idea is a great addition to the Steadicam lineup. The thing that stands out most is that it features nine feet of continuous elevation and traverse with back-pan and back-tilt all coupled with full control over the camera angle.  The other great feature is that it actually has a significant payload which does not restrict the TANGO to POV cameras. You can put a 6lbs camera on the TANGO opening it up to most entry level professional cameras.  Cameras that are not limited to specific applications.  Ideally you can shoot on set with an EX1R and bring it over to your Steadicam and also do mobile jib shots on the TANGO all without need for a second camera (like a POV camera like on a Polecam unit).
This means keeping all your footage consistent without special app cameras. Matching POV cameras to set cameras has been difficult at best especially when involving styled looks.  Keeping a 6 lbs rating for the camera is key to the success of this product as it keeps it manageable and robust enough for everyday use and pulls it away from the special applications arena.

Without having used the TANGO personally I cannot really comment on its practical applications and how they translate to real world on set use. I can see that navigating at first might be a issue until you learn how to pivot and boom through doorways, etc.  I can see some amazing shots you could make like the camera end of the boom following someone up a flight of stairs to a reveal at the top, etc.  Steadicam has designed this rig so that you can achieve 360 degrees of range making navigation possible (although you will require to learn the appropriate moves).  As a Steadicam operator having trained several users I think the biggest surprise to a new user is how much of the movement is on you the user and not the rig.  I imagine classes will be available to learn these new methods and many will create their own way to move the rig and camera to accomplish certain shots.  With pan, tilt and roll all controlled by the operator we are sure to see some shots in the near future that will make us all ask how they were done.  There is an unlimited amount of potential for the TANGO's use not only in narrative but in documentary use and in the commercial realm.  The doors to coverage are wide open when you fully realize the potential outside of static use.  We have used Steadicam rigs on bikes, hard mounted to flatbed trucks, on ATV's, and even stepping off camera cranes.  Imagine all those shots but with the leverage and manipulation of the TANGO....truly remarkable shots to come.

The best part of the TANGO is that it will work with the new Zephyr, the Archer2, Ultra2, and other rigs.  Making the TANGO an accessory rather than its own rig was a smart play by Tiffen, as it would have impeded sales.  This added functionality is a major plus but as a stand alone unit I do not think it would have the same impact.

Overall I think the Steadicam TANGO is a great value added À la carte feature for Steadicam ops and makes it easy to get floor to ceiling type shots.  We have all heard or requested from a director for shots like this and in the past it required a jib on a dolly.  Even then it always required a fair amount of planing and the limitation was to the length and type of dolly track you had on hand. With the TANGO mobility is key.  In the past this required a MK-V AR and even then that was limited to the post option you had (post as in sled post not post production).  Although pricing is pending, I imagine the TANGO will be an affordable add on.

The Steadicam TANGO gives Steadicam operators a unique position to lean and master a new way of camera stabilization and mobility that the market is craving for.  The ability to perform maneuvers that are currently impossible without post trickery or limits like dolly tracks are now a reality. If I was a new Steadicam operator looking to stand out from the crowd (albeit a tiny one) I would seriously consider the TANGO as a value added service which one could become an expert on.

		<title>Reflecting on Tom&#039;s Top Ten.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As mentioned earlier, I wanted to jot down a list of things that I was interested in seeing at NAB 2010 BEFORE attending and then reflect on what I saw after the show.

In no particular order:

I saw far fewer iPad toting attendees than I expected but did see a new App from Blackmagic Design that controls their routers via iPad.

3D was everywhere as expected.  The caliber and price range varied wildly as did the methods.  The self contained Panasonic camera showed some promise, Si2K cameras mounted on Element Technica Neutron rigs were all over the place and I even saw a guy wandering around with two consumer video cameras bolted onto a banged up piece of press board recording the show!

Digital SLR is still maturing and I would imagine "taking over" by some account.   Accessory mounts were everywhere, from eyepiece contraptions, to mounts for small LCD monitors, to a Juiced Link audio adapter and ipod follow focus controllers.  What was under development and under glass were PL mount cameras from Sony and Panasonic that we won't likely see until next year but appear to squarely target the SLR marketplace.

It was promising to see a crowded show floor.  I heard estimates as high as 88,000 attendees.

The Arri Alexa camera is just on the horizon and there were several very nice lens packages out there from new and old lens manufacturers.

I looked hard for super low latency "live" H.264 encoder solutions but did not walk away with a magic bullet method.  My search is ongoing..

Sony showcased a very intriguing processor / software combo that allowed 3D cameras to get "close enough" to allow the Sony CELL microprocessors to do the fine tuning and adjustments.  Several test equipment companies such as Leader and Astro also showed 3D monitoring (luminance difference) tools as well.

I have to mention the GoPro Hero helmet and surf cameras simply because their booth was cool and the pictures that came from their matchbook sized camera was impressive.  John Rule snapped a photo of a little pug that was walking around with a camera mounted to his back.

I spent some time with both CatDV and with Cache-A.  We are looking forward to doing more integrations incorporating the two for asset management and archive purposes.  Shooting and editing with file based cameras really require a long-term vision for storing and searching as well as backup and restore and these guys both have a good grasp on how to do it.

The Steadicam Tango was a popular attraction in their booth.  Picture a jib arm with a smaller camera head (Si2K) being rigged to a roving operator with an on board Cinedeck and Transvideo HD wireless transmitter and you can get some shots not easily done otherwise.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As many of you know, Rule Boston Camera was recently selected to join an extremely exclusive group of resellers that will be offering the new Sony F65 Digital Motion Picture Camera for sale. We are all extremely excited to be part of this short list and have been preparing heavily for the camera’s launch at the beginning of 2012.

Last Thursday as part of that preparation we were lucky enough to have Hugo Gaggioni, Chief Technology Officer for the Broadcast and Production Systems Division at Sony, come speak to us internally about the camera’s capabilities. We had members of all departments—Rentals, Sales, Engineering, Quality Control, and Engineering Services—attend the training and WOW!  We were all blown away by the technology they have packed into this amazing piece of gear.

Hugo explained to us some of the unique features of the new F65 sensor and the way it processes and records the 16-bit RAW 4K images that the camera produces. He also talked about the new SRMASTER products, including the new SRMemory cards, SR-R1000 deck and SR-R1 and SR-R4 recorders. With sustained (that’s right, <em>sustained</em>) write data rates of up to 5.5Gbps and more recording capabilities than you can shake a stick at, Sony is certainly setting a new benchmark for image capture and recording with SRMASTER. Impressive, to say the least. While not for the faint of heart, true 4K recording is certainly the pinnacle of motion picture technology today.

Sony will be joining us again soon for a doubleheader Learning Lab (10am-12n) and Pub Night (6-8pm) on  Wednesday, January 25. We encourage EVERYONE to attend at least one of these informative events! We will soon be receiving both our in-house demo and rental units here at RBC, and we are very excited to introduce the newest addition of the the CineAlta line to New England. We'll keep you posted with news on the F65 as it becomes available, and if you are interested in learning more please contact us. Otherwise, we hope to see you all on January 25!

		<title>Out of Order Tour</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I had the opportunity to be the “Official Rule Representative” at the Out of Order Tour with Ross Hockrow at its stop in Woburn, Massachusetts last week. As an aspiring editor, I was very excited to attend. Ross Hockrow is an award winning filmmaker and newly published author of <em>Storytelling Techniques for Digital Filmmakers</em>. Hockrow is an expert on teaching filmmakers and editors how to tell their stories. Throughout the day, I became a better decision maker when it came to shot selection, pacing, and keeping the viewer engaged. We also learned Ross’ own technique for organization and building his timeline. In the end, there’s really no “one right way” to edit, but as long as you understand the basic concepts of conflict and plot structure, you will be a more effective storyteller.

As Hockrow explained it, there is an innate human need to tell stories. We are constantly trying to draw connections and fill in the blanks to make sense of the world around us. It is the editor’s job to lay down just enough clues to keep the viewer guessing, but to also give some context and explanation, so the viewer is able understand the conditions you are presenting in the story. Hockrow showed us <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv=UzSh51WinOo" target="_blank">this</a> short film to exemplify how good editing can take a selection of random shots and order them in a way that helps the viewer draw a connection between images and get an overall feeling of humor, wonder and harmony.

Next we went over basic plot structure, straight out of writing 101: Beginning, Middle, End. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.  As an editor, it is your job to create a clear distinction between these parts of the story. How are you establishing your characters? What is the mood? What is the main conflict? Hockrow gave us an overview of the different types of conflict and gave us examples (i.e. <em>The Social Network, </em>is an example of Human vs. Human conflict). Though sometimes not so glaring obvious, the viewer can still detect what the main conflict is based on the editors shot selection and time of their cuts. The key is that the conflict is based on the <em>main character’s perspective</em>. Their could literally be an apocalypse happening, but if the main character is more concerned about getting the girl, then the apocalypse is not the main conflict you should edit around – the romance is.

Another huge pointer I took home from the event was the importance of time and pacing. Hockrow took us through a demo that showed us how to cut together a conversation (the basis of all editing). He showed us how to make the conversation have a great flow by cutting out mistakes, cutting to the other subject, as well as giving breathing room and following character cues. He showed us that the more characters you have in a scene, the more cuts you would have, and the faster the pace would be. I absolutely loved Hockrow’s “eighty percent rule” when it came to a film’s length: A film should <em>feel</em> eighty percent shorter than the actual running time. If it feels too long, you are not pacing it correctly or something needs to be cut.

After a dinner break, Hockrow got down to business and showed us his work flow from shooting on the Canon C300 to logging in Adobe premier and dumping his organized footage into the time line. A “dump timeline” can seem like a radical approach when you are looking at it from afar, but to an editor having all the pieces in place to flesh out a story can actually be far less daunting than staring at an empty time line thinking “where do I begin?” As an editor it’s always a great learning experience to witness how someone else goes through his or her process.

Overall, the Out of Order tour was a great experience. Ross Hockrow is very personable and sometimes it’s just nice to have someone stop and tell you “THINK ABOUT YOUR STORY!” instead of focusing on simply matching the action and following a script. It seems basic, but it’s actually really helpful. I’m definitely going to be taking all the tips about pacing and timing with me. It was also just a lot of fun. If you didn’t get a chance to catch the tour, do yourself a favor and get the DVD available <a href="http://www.outoforder.com/dvd">here</a><a href="mailto:http://www.outoforder.com/dvd">.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>24 Hour Film Race - Boston Winners Announced</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=205</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The concept of the 24 Hour Film Race is pretty insane.  Late on a Friday night, you're e-mailed a theme (with a surprise element tossed in),  and you then have approximately 24 hours to write, shoot and edit a final 4-minute piece.  Insane, right?  Challenging, right?  An adrenaline-pumping blast, right?  Yes, yes and yes.  What's cool about this particular film race is that winners in Boston, for example, go on to compete against winning filmmakers in other cities across the country and in Canada.  The final winners (1 through 20) receive cash and other prizes.  As a result of this cross-country competition, both films and filmmakers get some substantial exposure.

Boston's winners were announced this week, with congratulations going to 1st Prize winner ''I ♥ U'' by Neoscape and other runners-up listed in order below:

1)  ''Moving On'' by Castparty Productions

2)  "Double Edged Sword'' by Mango

3)  ''P.H.O.N.E. 300K'' by Electric Shark Dog

4)  ''Pallino'' by Bait &amp; Tackle

To watch the winning films, go to http://www.filmracing.com/.  It's not too late to register for film races in Portland (Oregon) and Toronto. Screenings (leading to more winners) will take place in Denver and Seattle.  Winners have also been announced in Chicago, Miami and Minneapolis (in addition to Boston).

		<title>Hummingbirds with the Canon 5D Mark II</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had brought my Canon 5D MKII along this memorial day weekend in anticipation of taking some set stills, but found myself on a small nature shoot. The subject was two hummingbirds who were hanging around a feeder that was put out.  I put a Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L series lens on my camera and had hoped to at least get a few out of focus pictures of these very fast birds.  Instead I decided to put the 5DMKII into video mode and the shutter speed at 4000 making the appropriate adjustments to aperture and ISO settings.  I waited frozen for a few minutes and then one flew up to the feeder and then banked off into the sky within seconds.  I decided to throw the lens into macro mode and go even closer, knowing they would be back for the sugar water to fuel the pace at which they were flying.  Within 4" of the lens the female flew into frame and  decided to stay a while completely ignoring me (frozen still with camera).  She stayed for over 60 seconds and flew out of frame making for the perfect shot.

<object width="480" height="288"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ixns3k-4rQI&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ixns3k-4rQI&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="288"></embed></object>

I had never thought of using the 5DMKII for nature work (video) in the past and this experience made me rethink a few things.  I had shot nature footage before with long lenses on my Aaton XTR cameras, and the Arri SR2, etc but it was always a lengthy process and required a lot of gear to make it happen.  I had also shot stock footage of turtles, frogs, cranes, and other water animals with XL2's, SDX900's, etc but it too wasn't the same as this experience.  Being able to stealthily whip out the 5DMKII and within seconds start shooting hardly seemed like work.  Getting to the shutter speed, ISO, F-Stop, and Depth of Field preview all took seconds to accomplish.  I highly recommend a follow focus and basic support, as the camera is front heavy with most lenses and hand-holding can become very fatiguing fast (especially the the heavy lens, battery grip, and other accessories).  Outside of that setups were a breeze and really allowed for a lot of freedom to rapidly adjust settings.

In the future I would definitely bring a Canon 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens and maybe the 185mm f/3.5L Macro USM which would have yielded much better results.  A tripod or mono pod couldn't have hurt either. ;)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...the first high-speed HD camera arrived at Rule yesterday.  With up to 1000 frames and 2K resolution, it's quite easy to use, especially with laptop and controlling software (although more difficult with on camera controls).  It requires some learning!

This camera has firmware v.661.  It is controlled by v.687 of Phantom Camera Control (PCC) software (on laptop) now. The newer software is available - v.689, but we have to make sure, that it works properly. There have been some issues reported.  We'll keep you posted!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eight Vision Research Phantom v640 and five Phantom HD cameras are currently being used in South Africa to shoot the 2010 World Cup Soccer Tournament.  I watched a few games already, and noticed that the slow motion was used very frequently -- and not just for replays of the latest goals, shots or fouls, but also to show the audience dancing, singing and enjoying the show.  I  specifically liked the close-up shots of the athletes' faces in slow motion with muscles rippling under the skin, showing all the effort and emotion and delivering quite a new visual quality...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We received a sensor upgrade for one of our RED One cameras recently.

The MYSTERIUM-X (or M-X) camera now delivers around 13 stops of dynamic range and may be operated over an ISO rating range of 100 to 6400 ISO.

So far, so good... I'm glad to report no problems with the upgraded camera.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had heard about this cleaning brush/loupe combo for CCD/CMOS sensors before.  So we eventually got it, and we're glad we did.  I'm happy to report that it's an excellent tool and it works great! We got the Arctic Butterfly® 724 (Super Bright) equipped with 2 super bright LEDs Sensor Brush &amp; Visible Dust BriteVue Sensor Loupe 7X. First, you look at the sensor with lighted loupe, find the dust particles and clean the brush, rotating it (electric motor is built-in) while simultaneously charging the fibers (electrostatic charge).  You then swipe the sensor clean with it and confirm it's condition with the loupe. Rotate the brush again to get rid of the dust.  Done.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a rental house, we have supplied the lineage of ARRI cameras for close to 30 years.  The transition from film to digital cinema has introduced many players into the camera production game, but for the most part ARRI has been in the digital shadows with the limited mainstream success of their D-20 and D-21 cameras.  The Alexa is the first ARRI Digital Camera that holds great promise for a wide range of cinematographers and a variety of productions.  Our Rental Department is  very excited about the release of this new camera system, and we anticipate the camera quickly becoming the first choice for commercial as well as feature productions.  Its compact design, light-weight and well-conceived accessories along with its affordable price will serve to make it a versatile tool right out of the box.

The Alexa is the ideal camera for both the rental house and the shooter because it takes all of the same lenses and accessories which former ARRI cameras used.  The Super 35mm chip size will afford a level of DOF and Field of View familiar to cinematographers.  The Alexa offers multiple options for recording images.  Commercial productions will be attracted to the camera's ability to record Quicktime/ProRes files to two onboard SxS cards for an easy post workflow.  The Camera also has the ability to record ARRIRAW files to a third party solid-state recorder which will be an attractive option for features demanding the full potential of the 35mm sensor.

We will be receiving our first two cameras hopefully as early as this August (yes, next month!).   We'll quickly offer them to the rental market and host a session in the Learning Lab to detail the production potential of the camera.

		<title>Grandpa Rule sees the Future</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a lot of family lore about my grandfather, John T Rule II, who was an author and Professor of Mathematics at MIT and Dean of Students between 1956 and 1961. He was good friends with Dr. Edwin Land (the founder of Polaroid) and in fact, together during World War II they invented the first 3D bomb-sighting mechanism which greatly improved the Allies' reconnaissance and bombing efficacy.

And this is the really interesting part: Earlier, in 1939, Grandpa and Dr. Land had collaborated on the very first commercial use of polarized 3D when they created the "In Tune With Tomorrow" film for the Chrysler Pavilion at the 1939 Worlds Fair (mentioned <a href="http://www.newsarama.com/film/090916-top-3d-milestones-1.html">here</a> as the no. 9 milestone in 3D Movie history). So as I was researching this subject, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/12/movies-and-tv-murder-or-merger/6082/">this piece</a> that he wrote for the October 1953 edition of the Atlantic, actually posted on the Internet!

In it, he discusses the then current state of the nascent 3D industry, decrying it's tendency towards sensationalistic gimmickry, and cautioning that badly done 3D would negatively impact the box office. He advises that 3D done artistically and in service to the creative goals of the Director will create an experience unmatchable by home televisions, thus stopping the theater industry's steady drop in customers.  Wow. People say that the more things change, the more they stay the same...it's hard to believe that he wrote this 57 years ago. My favorite part of this article is at the end where he proposes that feature films should be released first on TV with Pay-per-view before going to theaters! He's talking about Pay-per-view in 1953! It boggles the mind.

		<title>Zacuto Z-Finder Pro 2.5x in the field</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=294</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2010 17:14:28 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mike Sutton]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://bostoncamera.com/blog/?p=294</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If not using an on-board monitor for your HD-SLR camera, the Zacuto Z-Finder Pro 2.5x (Z-FIND-PRO2) is essential for Live View shooting with the Canon 7D and 5D Mark II.  Zacuto has constantly improved their viewfinders based on feedback from users.  It's good to see that they are implementing features that professional shooters have craved since the initial version of the finder.  Many would say to simply use the magnification button on the camera when setting-up your shot for focus, but if you shoot professionally (be it documentary, commercial, corp, etc.) you are dealing with moving subjects / objects, etc., so this doesn't work accurately.  Having a proper viewfinder and being able to focus with magnification (without taking your eyes off the frame) is a huge asset.  Personally, I found the 3x version of the viewfinder to be too much magnification, and it was a distraction when shooting.  Most shooters I have worked with and talked to seem to agree that the 2.5x is the perfect solution for handheld and rig shooting when or if an LCD is not viable.

First thing I noticed about the Z-Finder Pro 2.5x over the V2 of the finder was the mounting system.  The Gorilla Plate with DSLR mounting frame is very adjustable and can be easily mounted to a Canon 7D or 5DMKII without worry of it popping off or using bands like the older Z-Finder.   Using the 2.5X on the 5D required a bit of tweaking to the frame in order to position it but once centered, it was secure.  Using the 2.5x on the 7D seemed to have the best fit with minimal adjustment needed to center the finder over the LCD.

The second major improvement I noticed is that the new Pro finder did not fog up when used.  This is a huge improvement, so much to the point that Zacuto now has an anti-fog upgrade kit for the Z-Finder V2.  This upgrade is $22 and worth every penny if you have the older finder.  The Gorilla Plate comes with the 2.5x and the 3x.  It has several taped 1/4 20 holes in the bottom, but I suggest getting the plate adapter (Z-GRP-ADPT) for $17.50. This adapter will center your tripod mounting hole which will keep your pan axis point accurate.

For under $400 the Z-Finder 2.5x is a great deal.  Unlike monitors, you do not have to deal with power, cables, conversions (HDMI to HDSDI) etc.  You also do not have glare to contend with or other reflections on the monitor. The Z-Finder will block out all extraneous light sources so you can see your frame accurately. This is a must for doc filmmakers (where power and excess equipment can be an issue) who plan on using the 7D or 5DMKII camera in the field.  For the 5DMKII this will be even more of a must as monitoring the HDMI signal is only standard definition and getting critical focus is not happening with an on-board monitor.  This is where the Z-Finder 2.5x saves the shot.  You can achieve focus which, for this full-frame camera, is critical especially when using long lenses and wide open apertures.

		<title>Philip Bloom DSLR Workshop @ Rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Filmmaker / Blogger / Twitter fanatic Philip Bloom came to Rule Boston Camera courtesy of the Boston Final Cut User Group this weekend to hold a two-day workshop on DSLR filmmaking.  On Saturday, I was lucky enough to listen in and talk with Philip.  If you have followed his Tweets or his Blog you know that Mr. Bloom is very charismatic and witty.  He made it clear that he was open for questions and didn't want anyone to feel cheated by not getting the info they came for.  After seeing several examples of his non-commercial work (understandably, he cannot show his commercial work), it was clear that the audience had not yet taken their voyage into DSLR filmmaking as deep as Philip had.  His approach to shooting was very personal, and he has an affinity for the products he stands behind.

<a href="http://rule-blog.brattleconsultinggroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/PB.jpg"><img src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/PB-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-328" /></a>
Philip Bloom Workshop shot with iPhone 4 using Hipstamatic Float film and Helga Viking Lens.

The focus for the workshop was mainly the Canon DSLR lineup (T2i, 7D, 5DMKII, 1DMKIV), and he made it very clear that Canon was ahead of the game in the Video-via-DSLR department.  There were a few GH1 and Nikon users in the crowd, but, for the most part, it was a Canon user base.  Philip was very opinionated about the lack of quality on the GH1 (out of the box) and the Sony NEX-5, and the new Sony NEX-VG10 (essentially the same as the NEX-5 but in handycam form factor).  There was a lot of talk about codecs and low-light sensitivity which was rounded out with Philip expressing his preference for the Canon 5D Mark II over all the cameras currently on the market.   As a 7D and 5D Mark II owner myself, I've found that 90% of my kit (lenses, AKS, etc.) was identical to what Philip was using as well.  Philip's preferred lenses are the 16-35mm f/2.8L USM II, the 24-70MM f/2.8L USM, the 70-200MM f/2.8L IS USM II, the 100MM Macro IS USM, 50mm f/1.2L, etc, etc.  He suggested buying only L series lenses regardless of owning a T2i, 7D, or 5D MKII which I agree with 100%.  This was based on build quality, chromatic and other aberration minimization and their full-frame coverage.  For those of us who use Canon EF L series lenses, it was nice to hear Philip declare that the quality of these lenses are to resolve resolution much higher than any video camera lens can achieve, and he has had no issues with them.  Some of the best lenses in the world are Canon still lenses.  Full disclosure -- Philip has several Nikon lenses, a Nikon D3s, Sony EX1, Panasonic GH1, as well as a variety of other cameras.

A strong believer in the double sound system, Philip also keeps the Juiced Link 454 and a Beachtek DXA-5D in his kit for reference or shoots -- which will fit the bill.  His main concern with the single system method is not being able to monitor what the camera is recording and for his piece of mind he prefers an external recorder.  Audio bit rate has a lot to do with this as well. His main point is to use what works best for you as long as you have AGC Defeat on the Beachtek or the Juiced Link.    For Mics he prefers Sennheiser (as do I). Philip was a sound man back in the day, so it is a subject he is well-educated in with real-world practical experience.  For external recorders he stated the Zoom H4 is horrible and it's better to stick with a Tascam, Foxtex, Sound Devices or Marantz recorder with phantom power and ideally a backup power source.

Philip took a portion of the workshop to cover post-production and workflow.  His thoughts on it are fairly simple and concise and the defacto standard practice for most professionals.  Use the Canon EOS Movie Plugin-E1 for Final Cut Pro and use its Time-of-Day timecode via log and transfer just like P2 or SxS. It's the easiest way to get footage into your system.  You can utilize Magic Bullet Grinder or Squared 5's MPEG Streamclip if you want batch file copying.  Philip prefers the FCP method as it adds Time-of-Day timecode onto your clips which is why most of us use it.

A good portion of the workshop was on Time-lapse which featured various vignettes from around the world.  Prague, Dubai, Miami, NYC, Bulgaria, etc.  Most of these were done with the Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3.  With this intervalometer you can adjust start / stop time, length of exposures and the timer can be set for any time from 1 sec. to 99 hrs, 59 min, 59 sec.  You can achieve stunning time lapse if you allocate time to watch your camera.

Overall, the point of the workshop was to focus on shooting and just getting out there and doing it. Philip's suggestion to just buy a DSLR camera and stop worrying about what is coming out next was probably the best piece of advice heard at the workshop.  Waiting and waiting will not make you any money or get your project off the ground.  Technology does not replace talent and you can shoot a good movie regardless of what camera you use.  However, having a great inexpensive camera like the 5D mark II or 7D will make your projects more interesting and attract viewers you might not get if shot with a noisy 1/4" sensor.  Philip mentioned he still uses his Sony EX1 and fairly often as it is ergonomically correct for video, and it's a great camera.  DSLR's are not the one-all be-all solution for all situations.  The proper tool for the job might be a 7D or a Varicam 2700.

If you are a beginning filmmaker or if you have not yet taken the plunge, I would suggest taking Philip's workshop when it rolls around again in the Fall. In the meantime, come check out our free Learning Labs held every Wednesday.  If you are already in the mix and shooting, the workshop will be fairly redundant but would be worthwhile for networking, meeting new people, and talking with Philip in person.

		<title>Canon 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have owned the 100mm Macro IS for approximately a month now and have used it mostly for nature video and still work.  Although this lens is labeled and intended for Macro work it is a fully functional 100mm lens for telephoto use as well.  The lens features Canon's new Hybrid image stabilization which provides 4stops of stabilization correction which allows for hand held work were normally only a tripod would do.  The lens is an L series but unlike most is made of a durable black plastic instead of a metal body.  Do not let this fool you as the lens is very durable and I think it might be used on future lenses because of its weight, thermal properties, and for cost. The lens still features a weather sealed ring to mate up with your 5DMKII, 1DMKIV, or 7D.  Another great feature of this lens is that it has life-size close-up capabilities, something that would require the life-size adapter in the past with other macro lenses.

The fast 2.8 aperture is great for documentary work and in the field where bringing in additional light may not be an option.  The aperture features 9 blades in a circular pattern that provides a consistent bokeh.  The lens features a three position focus limiter to allow for quick AF if you are not in manual mode.  Reducing the range of focus that the lens has to hunt for makes the USM work within a split second to achieve subject focus, which can save your shot.  I sometimes find myself using this feature and once I am within range switching over to manual focus.

A great feature of this macro lens is adding the 2x extender which then gives you 200mm but retains the minimum focus distance.  I used this last weekend to shoot macro footage of a Praying Mantis eating an aphid for a project I am working on.  I knew I needed to be within 8 inches of the subject to achieve the framing I wanted but the 2x extender made it happen without sacrifice.  Because the lens is fast at 2.8 the lose of a stop was still well within the perimeters of the light that was available.

For video use the 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM is well matched in color and consistency to the typical lenses used.  I found it matched nicely with the 16-35, 24-70, 70-200.  Some post correction was required when inter-cutting with the 85mm 1.2, and the 600mm but overall it was minimal.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100mmISmacro1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-317" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/100mmISmacro1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
This is a still taken with the 100mm f/2.8L Maco IS USM lens at Lake Fairlee Vermont dusk, wide open 2.8 ISO 200 from a deck approx 100meters from the waters edge. Using the lens as a telephoto instead of a macro.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BTFM1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-334 alignleft" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BTFM1.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="461" /></a>
1" Tree Frog taken with same lens but using it as a Macro instead of telephoto mode.

Overall I think if you require a macro lens the 100mm f/2.8L IS USM is the route to go over the 50, 60, 65 and the 180.  Canon only has two L series macros, the 100mm and the 180mm, but the 180mm is f/3.5, does not feature IS, requires a tripod and is much heavier than the 100mm.  It is a great lens to have in your kit and I recommend you test one out when you have the chance as I have found myself using the lens as my standard 100mm tele for non-macro use.

		<title>Convergent Design NanoFlash</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=336</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are multiple field recorders currently on the market with several that stand out from the crowd.  The NanoFlash holds a unique position in this area as it is smaller than most units and is completely solid state with no moving components.

The NanoFlash is a huge step up from Convergent Design's first model, the FlashXDR, with regard to size, ease-of-use and flexibility. I think of the Nano as a bug-free version of the XDR, a sort of evolution of the product that was much needed.  I want to preface the fact that the NanoFlash is a 100% improvement over the XDR. Not only is the NanoFlash (as it's named) small, but it's packed with features that exceed most field recorders.  I have used the NanoFlash numerous times on Steadicam shoots as an on-board recorder and back-up for the camera; and it's always been rock solid -- never failing me in terms of functionality or expectations.  Eventually I started requesting it on commercial jobs strictly as a secondary (and in some cases as a primary) solid-state back-up recorder.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://staging.rule.com//blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-3.36.28-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-3.36.28-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
I recommend the NanoFlash for any camera that has an HD/SD-SDI output or HDMI output as a fail-safe or as a way to rejuvenate life into a tape-based camera that has a great block and sensor. In most cases you can achieve higher quality than the codec in the camera itself (example Sony PMW-EX3 or EX1).  Both the EX1R and the EX3 are 35Mbps solid state cameras which are already of a fairly high quality to begin with due to their 1/2" sensors.  They do a pretty decent job with green-screening for example but when coupled with the NanoFlash at 100Mbps the keys are significantly better and require less feathering and tweaking of the image.  There is a visible difference between footage shot onto the SxS card versus the NanoFlash.  Many field users use the Nanoflash as the primary recorder and the SxS cards as a back-up due to the bump up in quality of the recording.  Outside of cameras that have lower bit rates, the NanoFlash also helps retain the value of your higher-quality, tape-based cameras and keep up with current tapeless work flows.  Another prime use of the Nanoflash is for POV camera heads like the Iconix HD-RH1 and Toshiba IK-HD1 that do not have a recorder built-in.  Because the NanoFlash has a Hirose 4-Pin power connector there is a host of powering options from Hirose, Anton Bauer P-Tap, XLR4 Pin, etc.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-3.36.54-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-3.36.54-PM.png" alt="" width="491" height="187" /></a></p>
Highlights that stand out immediately are the selectable bit rates that vary from 18 to 280Mbps and 4:2:2 sampling.  100Mbps is of course the perfect balance of bit rate and storage availability.  Footage can be recording in Quicktime, MXF, or MPG (Sony MPEG2 Codec) formats which work with the majority of NLEs out there including Avid Media Composer and Apple Final Cut Studio.  The unit records to compact flash cards which are off the shelf items these days, which is a huge benefit since they are readily available in most cities and towns.  You can use two Compact Flash cards in the NanoFlash, but right now you can only record to one card at a time.  This will be changed in a future firmware update which, of course, will then allow for you to hand-off a copy to your editor and then vault or archive the second copy.  The other benefit over a built-in hard drive is that you can bring a pile of CF cards with you and continue to shoot without the need to dump the media.  All-day shoots are possible as the card spans to the next slot allowing you to swap out the card not being used.  Hot-swapping is a feature that is going to be added in a future firmware upgrade.

The NanoFlash has an on-board LCD display that features recording format, input format, time code, card capacity, battery voltage and audio levels.  Both the HD/SD-SDI and HDMI feature loop-thru and can be used as a playback recorder when hooked up to a monitor in the field or studio.   The unit features several methods of Timecode input like Embedded via HD/SD-SDI, LTC in, internal record run and Time-of-Day. I should mention audio -- the unit features a 3.5mm mini jack which in most cases will not be used if you are using embedded audio.  This feature is handy, however, if you want to feed from a field mixer instead of using the on-board camera audio.  When recording to 720 and 1090i the NanoFlash has limited capture frame rates but when recording 1080P or 1080PSF most common rates are covered like 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97 and 30.

I should mention there is a NanoFlash 3D which is comprised of two synchronized units for stereoscopic recording and playback.  The NanoFlash 3D features a combiner function to mix left and right frames to either side-by-side, top and bottom or line-by-line onto one HD-SDI cable.

If you are looking for a handy field recorder that will increase the quality of your work for under $3200 you should seriously consider the NanoFlash.  The company offers 24/7 support, and in my own experience with the unit, I have never had an issue with the product.  Convergent Design has issued numerous free firmware updates over the past year, each adding significant functionality to the product.   As a cinematographer, Steadicam operator and editor the benefits of the unit are strong for its price point.  For Steadicam, in particular, there really isn't anything that comes close in regard to size and versatility. I can see hundreds of other applications for the unit like helmet cams for skydiving, covert applications in law enforcement / military use, etc.

Wrapping up, if you have space constraints like shooting in a car or a jet, helmet cam, Steadicam, etc., the NanoFlash is a great choice for you.  If you are using a lower-end codec or your camera has an HD/SD-SDI spigot or HDMI output the NanoFlash can allow for higher-quality work.  If you simply need a simultaneous copy of what you are shooting or just do not have a way to record your footage, the NanoFlash could be the right choice for you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the various rumor sites, Nikon might be close to announcing a new video DSLR camera (D3100) in about a week, with another to follow in mid-september (D95).  While there is a multitude of speculation as to what will come out in press releases before Photokina from Canon and Nikon, we should digest our rumors slowly, and with several grains of hopeful salt.

		<title>Cartoni Lambda the Perfect SFX and Zero Gravity Head</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=364</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have worked with numerous tripods and heads over the past 18+ years, using the worst-to-the-best tripod heads. Some of my favorites are the O'Connor 1030, the Sachtler 7+7, Cartoni 120EX, Ronford Fluid 7 (a bit old school), Weaver Steadman 2 axis, and the Cartoni Lambda.   Most DPs and camera operators choose a tripod and head they are familiar with because of past experience, word-of-mouth or brand loyalty.  What do you do when your brand (Sachtler, O'Connor, etc.) doesn't offer a solution for a specific type of shot?  You need to look at complimentary gear or other solid foundations -- enter the Cartoni Lambda nodal mount head.  There are several nodal mount 2 and 3 axis heads currently in the rental world but none that have the versatility and the adjustment capacity of the Lambda.  I think it hasn't yet taken off due to the lack of education on how and why you would need a nodal head to begin with.  The size and weight (46lbs) of the head can also be intimidating if you don't know how it works. Many people assume it's only for large film cameras like the Arri 535 or BL4s, etc., but this is not the case.  You can use the Lambda head for two different, but similar situations.  The first one is if you want a head for instantaneous moves using the mass of the head and camera weight, but on a zero gravity basis.  This can be achieved by mounting the camera on the head by balancing the camera's weight evenly on the horizontal and vertical axis of the head.  Because the head is under slung and features numerous adjustments, you can also nodal-mount the camera on the horizontal and vertical axis of the camera's sensor or film gate and use counter weights if needed for perfect balance.  This is the reason why this head is great for SFX work, and it's the main reason you'll want to look at this head as an option for your next project.

Why would you want to mount the camera on its nodal axis points?  The main reason is that with traditional pan-and-tilt tripod heads, you cannot pivot on the horizontal or vertical axis of the cameras sensor or gate.  You can achieve horizontal axis centering but only with an additional side-to-side camera adjustment plate.  Vertical axis centering on the focal plane is impossible when tilting with a standard head as the camera sits on top of the head's pivot point and therefore cannot be aligned.  To get vertical axis centering on the camera sensor (or film gate), a nodal head or 2 or 3 axis head is required as its pivot point (axis point) can be aligned with the camera's gate or sensor plane.  Its can do this because the camera mounting plate sits below the pivot point.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://rule-blog.brattleconsultinggroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lambda.jpg"></a><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cartoni-3501.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-383" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cartoni-3501.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
What does pivoting on horizontal and vertical axis' do?  It allows for parallax free imaging, meaning you can remove foreground-to-background shifting that occurs with traditional heads. This is important when you need to isolate and lock up your foreground / background relationship. For any shots requiring forced perspective, a nodal mount head is required.  If you look at a movie like Elf or Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, these were shot primarily with nodal mount heads.  Mind you, for those types of shots, when you have something in the background and in the foreground that appear to be the same distance apart, you would also require either a split field diopter or a large depth of field.  Outside of that, however, the Lambda allows for these types of pan-and-tilt shots where traditionally these shots have to be locked off.  Using a nodal mount head also allows for focus retention when using a shallow depth of field as the distance on the sensor or the film gate does not change on pan and tilt.  There is no shifting or movement (as with a traditional tilt on a standard head) to throw your focus off with regard to distance; and with sensors on cameras getting larger and shallow depth-of-field being popular, this head will allow for greater accuracy with even conventional use.

A great aspect of the Cartoni Lambda head is that you can effortlessly tilt 360 degrees even with large cameras like the Arri BL4s including a large lens and 1000' mag.  You cannot do this on the Ronford F7, and it's much easier to set-up the Lambda than a Weaver, for example.  The Lambda features a small hand crank that allows for a large amount of overall vertical adjustment and a smaller crank for nodal vertical axis centering, all with indexing. This is built on solid dovetail plates unlike other nodal heads that use tubing. The head will also accommodate wide cameras or simply allow your 1st AC or video assist the necessary tech access to both sides of the camera with a fair amount of room on the right side to make adjustments. This is achieved by unlocking the sliding dovetail and extending the head horizontally.  Again--all indexed.  Once you have the camera centered and the head counter-weighted, you can achieve zero gravity panning and tilting.  If the camera being used has a smaller-than-the-minimal adjustment allowance on the head, a camera riser or mounting block is required to match head pivot axis with the camera's gate/sensor vertical axis. You will want to drop drag for both panning and tilting to zero for any camera lighter than 10lbs.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://rule-blog.brattleconsultinggroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cartoni-minimum3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-386 aligncenter" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cartoni-minimum3-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
The Cartoni Lambda is built like a tank and can accommodate cameras weighing up to 88lbs.  The head weighs in at 46lbs, but don't let that dictate your camera choice.  Because its a zero gravity head, there is no minimum camera weight.  This isn't exactly true as the camera either has to weigh equal to or more than the Cartoni's multi-adjustable tilt/pan handle.  I put several cameras on the head -- an Arri BL4S (approx 45lbs with 20-100 and 1000' mag), an SR2.5 Evolution (approx 18lbs with 50mm prime and 400' mag), a Sony PMW-350 (approx 15lbs with 16x lens and dionic 90 battery), and lastly a Canon 7D (approx 5lbs with 24-70mm, battery grip, and batteries) -- all of which exhibited the same effortless panning and tilting.  The Lambda features several adjustments of drag on both pan and tilt which even the heaviest of cameras will stay where it is placed (as long as it was balanced properly when centered and counterbalanced).

Overall, I would say that the Cartoni Lambda (which is very popular in Europe and on the West Coast) should be seriously considered when looking at a head to rent for your next project. The fact is -- the Lambda is pretty much the standard nodal head out west.  If you are shooting any type of special effects or force perspective -- the head is a must.  It should also be considered if you just want to be able to have unrestricted tilting that you cannot get from a traditional head.  It's heavy, but it's well worth it.  I shot with it for 6 hours of testing and it was completely effortless -- tracking subjects regardless of how fast they were moving. There is a 3rd axis option with this head for adding roll or dutch, which we currently do not carry, but if you absolutely need a 3 axis nodal head, you'll want to look at our Weaver Steadman with 3rd Axis option.

We will be featuring the Cartoni Lambda in a future Learning Lab.  Mention that you read this blog entry and get 10% off your rental of the Cartoni Lambda head.

		<title>Taking Advantage of Crop Factor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Should I get a Canon 5D MKII, 7D, or 1Ds MKIV ?  This is a question I am often asked when someone is looking to buy or rent an HDSLR.  There are several trains of thought that seem to be the main focus from one camera to another, and usually the conversation boils down to a low light and sensor size issue.  Yes, the 5D MKII has a significantly larger sensor over the 7D, and it does have better low light capability as a result, but there are other factors to be considered.  The focus of this specific blog entry is to address the factor of crop with the 7D and 1Ds MKIV, and how this can be seen as a positive rather than a negative.  I say this because I often hear people complain about using full frame lenses and the focal length multiplier as though this is a bad thing.   With regard to wide angle -- yes, it greatly reduces your focal length options.  On the telephoto end, however, is where this can be a huge advantage.

Before I go any further I will explain crop factor (I have seen several people try to explain it so I will keep it as simple as possible): When you use full frame lenses on non-full frame cameras (7D APS-C and 1Ds MKIV APS-H for example), the image appears bigger (magnified) because the field of view is smaller giving the lens a focal length multiplier.  <strong> </strong>

If you are shooting sports or nature subjects on stills or HD, you will want to leverage the focal multiplier of 1.6x of the 7D and the 1.3x of the 1Ds MKIV.  The benefits are -- you do not require a telephoto adapter or 2x or 1.5x extender.  The reasons for avoiding both are due to loss of 1 - 2 stops of light and the possible introduction of aberrations (chromatic and otherwise), flaring, trapping dust between optics, weight, etc.  You can always add a 2x extender onto a crop camera to get even tighter on your subject if applicable.

Here is a brief breakdown of some common telephoto focal lengths when coupling a full frame lens with a 7D:

85mm = 136mm,  100mm = 160mm, 135mm = 216mm, 200mm = 320mm, 400mm = 640mm, 600mm = 960mm &amp; 800mm = 1280mm

Now if you apply a 2x extender like the Canon 2x EF Extender II your 960mm (600mm) will become a 1920mm (with a loss of 2 f stops ).

There are factors to consider when using these new-found focal multipliers.  First thing to remember is that your foreground / background relationship does not change.  The lens properties remain the same unlike if you switched to a different lens. Second, you want to ensure that when using long lenses like the 100mm and above that you have some form of image stabilization built into the lens or a sturdy support system.  I managed to use the Canon 600mm this weekend on loan and threw it on my 7D for a 960mm equivalent focal length.  To use a multiplier like this requires you to either trigger the camera via remote or hold your breath while shooting as any bump, wind, etc. on the lens amplifies.  I had to use a heavy-duty video tripod with the release plate mounted to the lens foot to get anything useful on video.  This, of course, was an extreme field of view and not typical with focal lengths under 300mm.

A large benefit for crop factor is for use with macro video and stills.  I shoot a lot of macro HD video of everything from insects, reptiles, textiles,  products, etc.  Macro functionality even with the focal multiplier is retained -- which is important.  This can be handy when dealing with subject matter that may dangerous (shooting scorpions), or jumpy (see frog below), or when you just need more detail or a closer view without losing any stops of light.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/frog121.jpg">
</a><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/frog12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-406 aligncenter" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/frog3.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="284" />
</a>Green Frog with 160mm equivalent field of view. (JPEG still pulled from HD Video shot on 7D w/ 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS  @ f2.8 shutter 50, ISO 320 *scaled down from 1080)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are going to focus shooting HD video of  nature or sports, you should  take a look at the Canon 7D and Canon 1Ds MKIV as alternatives to the 5D.  The crop factor will save you the weight of lugging around a 400mm or 600mm lens, plus it will save money (long lenses are expensive), and it will keep you more inconspicuous when needed.</p>

		<title>The New Panasonic AG-3DA1 3D Camcorder</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Rule Boston Camera just received the Panasonic AG-3DA1 camcorder which I decided to take out this long weekend for a test drive.  The camera is similar in shape and weight to the Panasonic HPX170 camera with the exception of its dual lens and longer lens hood. The camera is lightweight and has the core features of most camcorders with the exception that it shoots 3D and has dual HD-SDI outputs.  The 3DA1 uses dual SDHC cards to record media with one card for left eye and one for right eye.  One of the great things about choosing SDHC cards is that they fairly plentiful and inexpensive.  Tracking down an HD deck with dual HD-SDI inputs is difficult and expensive so this camera embodies simplicity and ease of use by going with common media.  Since the camera records AVCHD codec (MPEG4/H.264), SDHC cards are more than fast enough to write to and even a class 4 card will work.   Each card is given a channel and fed time code so it stays in sync in post when locking up left and right channels. The camera has three methods of output, dual HD-SDI, HDMI 1.3 and cards via a card reader to transfer.  There are no analog outputs for composite, component or S-video.  Audio is handled via the on-board stereo mic or via two XLR audio inputs.  Audio is embedded on the HD-SDI and HDMI and can be monitored via a 3.5 mini headphone jack on the back of the camera.  The built-in mic picked up a fair amount of noise during testing so an external mic is essential especially if used on-set indoors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3D-head.jpg">
</a><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3d.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-435" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3d.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="640" /></a> Panasonic AG-3DA1 head on</p>
First, I would like to say that if you have ever shot anything in 3D before with either a side-to-side or beam-splitter rig, you'll find that this camera is very easy to use.  Unlike the aforementioned rigs, you don't need to worry about adjusting two lenses simultaneously for focus, zoom and iris.  Left and right eyes must match in focal length, focus and zoom or the 3D effect is blown, so a lot of control is required with traditional rigs.  The 3DA1 lenses are electronically and mechanically linked so focus, zoom and iris are tied automatically without the need for external hardware.   The AG-3DA1 allows you the freedom to focus without the technicalities of 3D inhibiting the creative process (to an extent).  With all that being said, this camera is not a run-and-gun camcorder.  If your shots are not locked down but stationary, it will work fine.  If you plan on Steadicam, dolly shots, zooming or any movement with the camera, you must plan for it in advance.  You have the ability on the camera to dial in convergence (where the optical axes of the left and right lenses converge) which allows you to dictate what is in the foreground and what is in the background -- providing a sense of depth. While this ability is great, if it goes unplanned your shots could become unusable because the left and right eye are separate channels and not multiplexed together.  This can be corrected later (to a degree). Something else to consider is that the convergence adjustment utilizes the same dial as iris and is switchable, so you cannot adjust iris and convergence at the same time.  As long as you plan for this it should not be a problem, but if you are shooting from room-to-room or outdoors-to-indoors, for example, you should plan on remaining equidistant to the subject at all times so you can adjust exposure without affecting convergence.  There is a mix feature on the camera that will allow you to display left and right channels superimposed onto the swing-out viewfinder.  This allows you to see any convergence adjustments you make that you might not otherwise see when monitoring on a single channel.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3D-head2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3D-head2.jpg" alt="" width="469" height="350" /></a>AG-3DA1 on Kessler Revolution motorized head.</p>
The Panasonic AG-3DA1 features I'm bringing to light are not to dissuade you, but to keep you informed so you can plan properly.  The camera features a slower boot time than most camcorders (approximately six seconds).  This could potentially be an issue but doesn't really pertain to commercial work or feature work where the camera is turned on well in advance to shooting.  The camera features two 3CCD 1/4.1" chips, so if you are planning to shoot indoors, you will need to consider a light kit due to the nature of the smaller sensors.  Noise in 3D is not pretty and can be very distracting, so it is imperative to have as much light as possible so you are not shooting at the lower threshold of the lens and sensors capabilities.  The sweet spot seems to be f/5.6 and higher on the lens.  Because the lenses are smaller there seems to be a bit more chromatic aberration than on an HPX170 for example.  This can have a large impact if you plan on shooting for Anaglyph Amber Blue or Cyan Magenta as it will pop on the screen.  There are post tools to reduce this, but, again, well-planned shooting and monitoring on set are probably the best ways to combat any potential issues.  You should plan on using a Kesson 50' measuring tape or equivalent on location as the minimal focal distance of the 3DA1 is only 3'97" but the reference plane adjustment range for convergence adjustment starts at 7'2" and goes to infinity.  You have to keep this in mind when shooting in order to maximize the 3D depth control as much as possible.  The camera does a fair amount of control on its own but the convergence adjustment is on the user to adjust if you want your footage to have any real depth to it.  There is a convergence display on the LCD that shows C00-C99 as a guide but its is only for rough estimation, and it is not accurate.  It also does not correlate to any system of real measurement.  The higher the number, the further away it is.  I tried to figure out a way to calculate based on these numbers but it never seemed accurate when using the camera day-after-day.  I used the shot marker whenever I racked convergence so that I would have a reference point in post when viewing in 2D single channel.  The convergence dial that shares Iris is small but usable and takes some getting used too.  After the second day of shooting, I got the hang of switching from iris to convergence and using the dial for both without taking my eye off the viewfinder, but it took a fair amount of practice.  There is also a button that will turn on 3D guide display, but, again, this is only for rough estimation, and it has no accurate distance of measurement built in. Zooming with the camera requires manual convergence adjustment to keep your subject depth accurate.  This is not automatically handled in the camera.

It is highly recommended that you rent a 3D capable monitor if you rent this camera.  If you plan on shooting well and if you measure everything out, this is less of an issue, but realistically there is more to consider than just distances and convergence.  Another potential issue:  reflections and highlights which in the 3D world really pop on the screen and can be distracting, ruining your shot.  There were several shots I did that in 2D looked great, but when shot in 3D they were blown.  If I had monitored on location with a 3D monitor like the Panasonic BT-3DL2550, a 25.5" 3D LCD I would have caught these highlights immediately in order to see which adjustments could be made to correct them.  This monitor will be available in the Rental inventory soon.  This next point might seem obvious, but, because both cards record simultaneously, you cannot eject a card while shooting or your shot will be lost. In a world of cameras that shoot dual solid state media, many people forget that you must treat the two cards as one card. Luckily the cards are located behind a locked plastic door which will keep you from accidentally pushing into and ejecting a card.

The next major consideration when using the camera is post-production.  In my test case I used CineForm Neo 3D via FirstLight rather than as a plug-in on a MacPro 8-Core with 16GB of RAM.  A decent amount of RAM is a good idea especially if you are making adjustments and want to have real-time playback in the viewer.  Neo 3D works directly with the AG-3DA1 and allows you to bring in right and left channels independently. The main benefit of Neo 3D is that you can work with your footage in post without having a 3D monitor if you choose anaglyph and if you have the appropriate 3D glasses to match.  Luckily 3D glasses are trendy again and you can find them almost anywhere! My local gas station sells cyan magenta glasses for $1.  I picked up a pair and they worked perfectly.  Once in Firstlight you can select side by side, stacked, fields, onion skin, difference, anaglyph cyan magenta, anaglyph black and white, anaglyph amber blue, etc.  You can also swap eyes, monitor in 2D or just use left or right eye views.  In passive mode you can adjust parallax using the built-in vectorscope which you can also burn into the video. Working in the 3D tab of Cineform Neo 3D, you can adjust horizontal and vertical which can correct any convergence mistakes that might have been made in addition to depth tilt. This is all keyframe-able as well. There is also correction for primary curves on the encode and decode as well as Debayering and basic looks that can be assigned to the footage. If you do not have Cineform Neo 3D there are other solutions that will work such as the Quantel Pablo, Avid Media Composer (3.5 and up), Final Cut Studio (with plug-ins), Iridas, Dashwood 3D toolbox, Adobe and others.  A plug-in for CineForm Neo3D for Adobe will be released within a few months.

To sum up the experience, the Panasonic AG-3DA1 was great to work with.  Again I cannot reiterate enough the importance of being prepared in advance with pre-production, production and post-production well thought-out before shooting.  This should be the case with any shoot but more so with the special considerations of 3D.  The idea of a 3D camera that can be used with little to no crew is unheard of and the 3DA1's small form factor allows for shots you could only get with a SI-3D rig.   If you are planning to shoot 3D but have no experience with 3D beam-splitter rigs or side-by-side rigs, and if you have a small budget, you really should check-out the AG-3DA1 camera.  You, too, can make a 3D feature, short, commercial, web project or spot without significant training or budget.  The Panasonic AG-3DA1 is now available in Rentals.

<h1>Sony Professional strengthens XDCAM line-up</h1>
<h1>with PMW-500  and XDCAM Station</h1>
Sep 10, 2010

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pmw500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" title="Sony PMW-500" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pmw500.jpg" alt="pmw500" width="275" height="207" /></a>

New 2/3-inch XDCAM HD422 memory shoulder camcorder and XDCAM  Professional Media Station  reinforces commitment to choice and  innovation

</div>
<div>
<div>

<strong>IBC, Amsterdam, 10th September 2010</strong> – Sony  Professional today announced the latest additions to its hugely popular  XDCAM HD422 line-up. The new products, which re-emphasise Sony’s  continued commitment to the thousands of XDCAM users around the world,  include a new XDCAM HD422 memory camcorder – the  PMW-500.

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

The PMW-500 combines the exceptional picture quality of  the PDW-700 with the operational flexibility of recording onto solid  state SxS memory card.  The PMW-500 is equipped with  three 2/3” Power  HAD FX CCD image sensors and can record both 1080 and 720 HD pictures at  50 Mb/s. It is ideal for broadcasters, rental companies and freelancers  looking for a versatile memory based camcorder.  Major broadcasters,  including RTL TVI in Belgium and WDR in Germany are amongst the first to  already have placed large orders ahead of product  ex-factory.

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

“The PMW-500 represents the next step in the evolution of  the XDCAM product range,” said Richard Brooking, of Sony Professional.  “Since 2003, XDCAM has become an industry standard with over 150,000  units sold worldwide.  Customers have been requesting an XDCAM HD422  memory camcorder for some time to sit alongside the phenomenally popular  PDW-700 Professional Disc camcorder. So we are very happy to be  launching the PMW-500 at IBC.”

The PMW-500 has two slots for  recording onto SxS Memory Card*.  First introduced to the XDCAM EX range  in 2007, SxS memory card provides an extremely high level of  reliability and fast access to recorded data, both critical in demanding  professional operations.  At IBC, Sony is also adding a new higher  capacity 64GB (SBS-64G1A) card which can record 2 hours of material at  HD422 50Mbps MXF mode, or more than 4 hours of material and has an  increased transfer speed of 1.2Gbps (SBS-32G1A &amp; SBS-64G1A).  The  PMW-500 ex-factory will be within October 2010.

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

Other key features of the PMW-500 camcorder include:
<ul>
	<li>XDCAM HD422 codec for exceptional picture quality at low data rate.</li>
	<li>Switchable between MXF and MP4 for recording in XDCAM HD422, XDCAM HD and XDCAM EX modes.</li>
	<li>Option to record MPEG IMX and DVCAM material allowing users to migrate to HD at their own pace.</li>
	<li>Interoperability with major NLE systems enabling smooth workflow migration.</li>
	<li>Lower power consumption for extended record time during shooting.</li>
	<li>Four channels of uncompressed 48 kHz digital audio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

Another major introduction at IBC is XDCAM Station, a  family of professional media recorders that bridge the worlds of SxS  Memory card and Professional Disc.  There will be three models in the  line-up:
<ul>
	<li>XDS-1000 - featuring an SxS Memory card slot and internal HDD storage</li>
	<li>XDS-PD1000 - featuring an SxS Memory card slot, a Professional Disc drive and internal HDD storage</li>
	<li>XDS-PD2000 - featuring an SxS Memory card slot, a Professional Disc drive and internal SSD storage</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

Depending upon the model chosen, customers can copy  material from SxS memory card or Professional Disc onto the Hard Disc or  Solid State storage within the XDCAM Station.  The material can then be  accessed for non linear editing or can be replayed under slow motion  control.  SDI input and output and network capability allows the device  to function as an MXF gateway linking XDCAM media, baseband video and  networked operation.  The Professional Disc based models will also be  able to record and read Sony’s new higher capacity 128GB Quad Layer  Professional Discs, PFD128QLW.

“These are extremely flexible  devices offering yet more creative options for XDCAM users,” explained  Richard Brooking. “We see applications within broadcast centres where  customers can use XDCAM Station as an ingest gateway for their SxS  memory card and Professional Disc media, and also on location for live  applications and material sharing between camera operators and  production staff.”

The XDS-1000 will be available from March 2011, with the XDS-PD1000 and PD2000 available in summer 2011 along with PFD128QLW.

*Recommended media for PMW-500 and XDCAM Station series are:
SxS PRO: SBP-32, SBP-16, SBP-8
SxS-1: SBS-64G1A, SBS-32G1A, SBS-32G1  (**only SBS-32G1 needs firmware upgrade in the memory media itself.)

<img src="http://www.aja.com/cmsimages/news/124.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="434" />

September 10, 2010
<h4>3G/HD-SDI to HDMI 1.4a and SDI converter enables simple 3D playback on monitors and projectors</h4>
Amsterdam, Netherlands, IBC Conference Stand 7.F11 (September 10,  2010)--AJA Video Systems, a leading manufacturer of professional video  interface and conversion solutions, announced the availability of  Hi5-3D, a new mini-converter that combines dual 3G SDI inputs into  various multiplexed 3D formats for output on true 3D HDMI 1.4a and SDI  to enable simple, flexible stereoscopic viewing on 3D monitors and  projection systems.

The Hi5-3D’s true HDMI 1.4a output supports EDID transactions that  automatically configure 2D/3D functions according to the HDMI monitor’s  capabilities. Input SDI 2 is frame-synchronized to input SDI 1 in 3D  modes and SDI input audio is embedded in both the HDMI and SDI outputs.  Hi5-3D also supports 2-channel RCA audio output with user control of  channel selection, along with AJA’s Mini-Config application for user  configuration and firmware download. Other key features include:
<ul>
	<li>Side-by-side, top-bottom and frame-packing modes</li>
	<li>Complete H and V image flip control in any combination</li>
	<li>Easy user control via dipswitch or USB</li>
	<li>Support for both 2D and 3D inputs</li>
</ul>
“3D has brought a new level of complexity to post-production  workflows, and our goal is to help simplify that,” said AJA President  Nick Rashby. “The Hi5-3D converter automatically combines SDI input into  stereo output and enables video pros to quickly and easily view 3D on a  monitor or projector without making major changes to the workflows they  already have in place.”

Hi5-3D is available In October, and US MSRP is $495. For a complete  set of features and technical specifications, please visit www.aja.com.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This Wednesday September 15th we are excited to showcase (and to experiment with) a newly announced 2/3" SxS camcorder called the PMW-500 which combines XDCAM Optical Disc performance with solid-state memory workflow.

[caption id="attachment_469" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Sony&#39;s new PMW-500 full shoulder camcorder."]<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/PMW500CU.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-469" title="Sony PMW-500" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/PMW500CU-300x147.jpg" alt="pmw500" width="300" height="147" /></a>[/caption]

You could say that it blends many of the best features of the XDCAM HD Professional Disc cameras such as the PDW-700 or PDW-F800 with the SxS solid state recording technology of the XDCAM-EX lineup.   This camera was just announced the other day at IBC 2010 and we are happy to have Sony's Kaori Uno and local DP Doug Jensen with us for a hands-on, practical and informative introduction to the latest in the XDCAM line-up.

Please join us at 10:00 am.  We look forward to seeing you!

		<title>New Sony HD Camcorder - PMW500!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a chance to see the new Sony Camcorder - PMW500, here at Rule Boston Camera, recently.

It is full size 3x2/3" CCD (not CMOS) camcorder recording on the SxS cards (2 slots) using XDCAM HD 4:2:2, 50Mb/s codec. The pick up section is identical to the high-end PDW F800 -- it can  record in XDCAM (UDF) and XDCAM EX (FAT) modes and file formats.

The software available now - XDCAM Clip Browser EX and XDCAM Transfer Tool work with the files, but Sony promises a new XDCAM Browser, incorporating functionality of both, into one application.

The camera looks and feels good. It bridges the XDCAM (Disc) and XDCAM EX (SxS card) worlds, and promises high quality for SxS recording. It will probably appeal to EX1R/3 users asking for better quality picture. For XDCAM-on-disc recording users, it is a cheaper alternative, but they have to embrace the world of proper data back up and file management.

The LCD screen is very good quality, power consumption is 29W, which is not bad either. Recording times are long depending on the SxS card size.

The price puts it above PMW350 and under PDW700/F800.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We just installed the Ki Pro v2.0 upgrade yesterday on all the Ki Pros in our Rental inventory.  Here is what to expect...

Ki Pro version 2.0 New Features

The following features are implemented with version 2.0 firmware:

• 8 channel embedded audio support-choose between 2 channels or 8 channels of audio via embedded SDI

• Multi-unit Gang recording via the Web UI-use the web UI and ethernet connections to Ki Pro units on a common network to start and stop recordings

• Custom Clip Naming-allows users to define their own naming convention using the front panel UI or the web UI

• RS-422 support-allows interaction with some serial control devices and some non-linear editors

Note: AJA has specifically tested with JL Cooper and FutureVideo 9-pin serial controllers. Other controllers may also be used, but may have not yet been tested by AJA. AJA has specifically tested 9-pin serial control with Apple Final Cut Pro's Log and Capture and Edit to Tape for RS-422 compatibility.
Other non-linear editors, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Autodesk Smoke and Sony Vegas, do not yet fully support ingest/output control via RS-422 when used with Ki Pro. Future firmware updates to Ki Pro will continue to add support for additional non-linear editors when controlling Ki Pro via RS-422.

The following features are not implemented with this firmware release, but are planned for future firmware releases:
• ExpressCard/34 media support
• LANC and Lens Tap control of the device
• Use of FireWire 400 port for timecode data
• Use of FireWire 800 port for connecting Ki Pro to host computer as "media reader"

		<title>A Unique Dual-Purpose Integration: Mobile &amp; Fixed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The most recent integration project started with a phone call from a local producer who planned to build a portable HD control room for Harvard's School of Public Health. As initially conceived, this would involve a switching flypack that would move between 2 separate spaces in one building and provide all the control gear to turn a conference room or large performance space into a remote camera production studio.  We were familiar with the construction of a portable flypack and the installation of remote cameras but putting these functions together presented some interesting challenges.  For example, where was the line between the portable and the installed equipment?  How do we connect the 2 systems so they’ll work well together and separate easily?  These questions made the project unique, and we were definitely up for the challenge.

Once we started working on the portable production aspect, the architects who were overhauling the conference room suggested we design and build the audio/visual portion in that space.  Consistency was the main objective.  By building the mobile flypack first, once in the conference room, it had to work in tandem with the audio visual components (e.g., teleconference, boundary microphones, resident computers, a VERY large display, etc.) in this more permanent space. It was the right way to handle this type of design, and as we moved through this particular phase, we became increasingly aware of the relationship between both aspects of the project.

Overall, whether the production equipment is mobile or in the control room, the
objective was to produce the highest quality HD material for both live streaming over the web and broadcast feeds to a variety of news outlets.  Because both systems would overlap in some of their hardware, it meant that much of the equipment in the conference room would conform to very high specifications.  For example, it’s not common to use a high-end HDSDI signal to feed a teleconferencing system.  It’s also not common to use Lite Panels (production lighting) on the speaker in a conference room setting.  The dual purpose for this space made the high-end choices budgetarily necessary.

After wrapping up the design phase, and then preassembling and testing the gear in our shop, construction is finished and we’re now moving the gear on site in order to have the entire room tested and ready for production early next month.

At this particular point in the project, it strikes me that despite all the overlap within these 2 co-existing systems (and no matter what the final purpose of the room) -- video is still video and audio is still audio!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was recently sitting in the Showroom looking over the latest additions to our stock.  We're steadily adding to the inventory, so I'll post what's new in the Showroom as it comes in.  In the meantime, if you’ve been reading Mike Sutton's blog posts or following the latest technology in the Learning Lab sessions you'll know what's new!   While I was in the Showroom writing this, one of our engineers, Alex Ulloa, came running down the hallway with an unfamiliar-looking manual, and as he pressed it against the glass everything went blurry.  And I bet the same thing will happen to you when you check out the new Panasonic 3D cameras.  They're currently being tested by our engineers and prepped for rental and demo use.  If you’re looking to buy one, check in ASAP!  For a sense of what they look and feel like when shooting, check out Mike Sutton's blog post (he recently took one out for a test drive), or come to the October 20th Learning Lab which is all about shooting with the AG-3DA1 3D camera and the BT-3DL 2550 25.5" 3D LCD monitor (we'll provide the 3D glasses).

Another new product you'll see in the Showroom is the Euphonix MC Color used for Color Grading.  Most of you Final Cut Pro users have probably heard about it, but what you might not know is that Euphonix was recently bought by Avid.  We like the MC Color because Euphonix built it specifically to avoid breaking the bank.  Any other color grading option out there starts at $3,650.

Then there are the new tripods, specifically the Manfrotto 701HDV, 547BK, Sachtler FSB-6 SOOM tripod, Manfrotto 504HD, 546BK tripods (replacing the discontinued 503’s) and the standard Sachtler FSB-4 and FSB-6.

Last but not least, we're doing our best to get in some custom Canon and Zacuto catalogs.  I’m guessing that a lot of you are looking online trying to figure out which kit is best for you, so let us help you with advice from people who have already put together their own custom rigs and know the parts pretty well.  Bring your camera in along with any and all of your parts, and we'll help you rig them to go with what you need.  If there are any missing pieces, we’ll order them right then and there.  It’s nice to be able to build something that fits your needs, not changes them.

We’re becoming dealers for new brands by the week, adding Euphonix, Adobe, For-A, Ross and G-Tech relationships, so keep checking in!  We just got a LARGE shipment of Zacuto Z-finders and G-Drives so come in soon!

		<title>Recent Steadicam Workshop with Zephyr &amp; Scout</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=506</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2010 21:40:57 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the recent Columbus Day Weekend Steadicam Workshop with Peter Abraham, I was intrigued by a couple of things.  First off, the people that I spent those two days with were AWESOME.  You literally walk away feeling like you are best friends (check out the photos<strong> </strong>at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rule-Boston-Camera/46957103796?ref=ts).

Next to that, I got to use the new Steadicam Scout for the first time, which will be the replacement for the Flyer eventually.  The Scout is the first one in the country to be used in the workshop, so it was great getting a firsthand look at it, and seeing the differences and changes that so many people are going to want if they decide to update their Steadicam.  First off, instead of only having the ability to rig weights at both ends of the monitor, there is a screw-in spot in the middle, behind the monitor.  This gives you some added weight, and works well to balance out the 24 lb. capacity if you go up that high on top.  You can also slide the monitor backwards and forwards, which also works to balance out the weight.  Speaking of the monitor, it’s a new model, one not seen yet, and for being standard definition as well as glare proof, I was really pleased with the image and would buy it that way easily.

Many people have asked me my preference- Scout or Zephyr.  Well, after using both, they are different tools.  The Zephyr is definitely a bit heavier, but also is a nice feel, and a bit more robust if you’re using something like the Sony PMW-320, which is what we had on it.  The Scout is a nice middle range.  Heavier than the Pilot, lighter than the Zephyr.  The Pilot vest is also being redone, and there is a kit available to update yours if you want to.  The current Pilot vest is mostly Velcro and if you’ve ever tried to get it off while shooting- well don’t.  It’s like popping the packaging bubbles that your camera comes wrapped in.  Loud. The new kit gives you clips, etc., to make it a little more like the Zephyr and Scout vests.

And last, here are some tips from Peter Abraham himself (who by the way, shot Notorious B.I.G.’s first music video, and if you haven’t appreciated slight differences in Steadicam operators’ work, you will after watching this video).

Sand- Get a can of air and spray the Steadicam every so often to blow off the gimbal.  You won’t be getting sand out easily if you let it build up.  If you’re walking on sand and don’t want to kill your ankles, get metal screening from Home Depot or Lowes, and lay it down on the sand for support.

Shooting with DSLR- get a thin foam sheet from any fabric store, cut a small rectangle and screw in the camera to the Steadicam plate through that.  You won’t wear down the bottom of the camera, or scratch your Steadicam plate, and it won’t move around on you or come loose.

Self Adhesive Velcro- This stuff is magic.  Keep your ends on your vest tied down with it, use it to attach a water cover, keep a roll with you at all times.

		<title>System Integration at Harvard is Up &amp; Running</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In mid-October, the System Integration Team installed the Panasonic 103" monitor in the 10th floor conference room (which looks really great).  The monitor was hoisted by a crane up 10 floors through a window and then was stored in a closet while the construction part of the project was finished.

Like everything in this installation, the monitor will serve two separate masters.  In the conference room it will take the place of a typical projector and be used to show presentations and video conference calls.  When the room is used in production mode, the monitor will serve as an adjustable background.  Any of the sources in the room can be fed to the monitor through an HDSDI router.  It might "host" a still for one of the Forum presentations or you might see a moving background from the Final Cut Pro laptop system -- really, it could be anything!

In a typical conference room set-up, we would have created this scenario with a rear projection screen.  In this case, there was no room behind the screen for a rear projection system, but the necessity to show it on camera, perhaps under lights, made it necessary to use this monitor.

The monitor is a great showpiece for the room, and as they say "It really ties the room together."

Earlier last month, we received and installed the camera lifts that are now holding the 4 installed cameras in the ceiling.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  These lifts came from a company called Display Devices, and they were a pleasure to work with.  They customized the lifts per our specifications, and they delivered them on time. The builders and carpenters who installed them did a great job compensating for the weight of the cameras and tying everything into the ceiling in a way that looks great <strong>and</strong> works well!

Now the cool part... What these lifts do is allow the camera to mount flush with the ceiling in the "up" position in order to keep them out of the way when the room is used as a conference room -- yet they can still be used as a video conference camera.  In the "down" position, they arrive at about eye level so that they can be used in production mode without the high angle at which these cameras tend to me mounted.

These lifts have the cameras inverted, but the same lifts can be used with the cameras mounted inside the box allowing them to completely disappear from the room until they are needed.  Very cool.  I'm  looking forward to working with these lifts again on future projects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In past posts, I mentioned that this room at Harvard's School of Public Health, is interesting because of its dual purpose.  Well, on Friday we broke in the production part of the room.

Here is the techno-geeky breakdown of the shoot:

The goal was redundancy to prevent failure.  Four BRC-H700 Cameras mounted on ceiling lifts that lower them down to eye level when needed.  Each fed HDSDI into an AnyCast switcher.  Two more sources from an EX3 stationed in the room to provide a human operator better equipped to grab audience questions, and a PC running a PowerPoint.  The PC was converted through an Extron USP 507 to HDSDI and fed not only to the Anycast but also to two 40" LCD screens in the room for audience viewing.  Audio in from four wired lav mics in the room and one wireless hand held into a Shure mixer for processing then to the Anycast to combine with the video.  Also 8 Clock Audio ceiling mics through a Nexia DSP to the AnyCast for audience questions.  Music in from an iPod to open the show rounded out the audio scheme.

Recording was done on six different devices.  Two KiPros each taking a program feed from the AnyCast. Three camera backups to HVR-1500s, so that everything could be fixed in post.  There is also an audio recording done to a Marantz MP3 recorder.  This file was emailed directly after the event to have a transcript made.

In addition to all of this, the unit that we are using to do a live encode for the web does its own recording, a Digital Rapids StreamZ HD.  There is a future technology coming to the location as well.  Using VYVX, we will be able to transmit full-quality HD to any network in the world.

This system has a lot of complexity stuffed into a small space, but it all works very well.  I look forward to seeing many more of these events in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Alexa, the much-anticipated new digital cinema camera from ARRI, arrived last Monday in its factory-fresh box.  The Rule Boston Camera staff was obviously ecstatic to get their hands on the camera after various ARRI factory delays postponed its arrival.  Within its first few hours at our shop (<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/16472401">Arri Unboxing</a>), the Alexa was booked on its first rental -- a week-long commercial job.  Our Alexa made its first public debut at the PBS Quality Workshop at WGBH on November 4th, where the camera was eagerly inspected by the many who attended.

From a rental house perspective, the ARRI Alexa is a welcome tool in the transition from the ease and image quality of film-based acquisition to the current needs of digital cinema.  The camera will be an excellent choice for those looking for an alternative to both the RED and the numerous HDSLR systems currently being used in productions. We'll be hosting an upcoming Learning Lab dedicated to the features of the new camera, but in the meantime call or drop by with questions or to catch a glimpse of the Alexa.

		<title>PluralEyes for Avid Media Composer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been watching with envy as the Internet has been buzzing about PluralEyes and its auto-syncing technology, which brings some exciting news for Avid users... PluralEyes is available to most of the major NLEs: Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, Vegas <strong>and now Media Composer</strong>. The MC  version is currently in beta and offered as a free download to encourage  testing and, of course, feedback. This new version of PluralEyes uses  AAF to move files between the two pieces of software. Here’s a  step-by-step guide (as outlined on the Singular Software site):

In Media Composer, create a sequence and add the clips to it. They can  be positioned anywhere in the sequence, as long as all the clips from  each recording device (camera, audio recorder) go on their own track.
Export the sequence to AAF. Be sure to select all the tracks you want to sync first.
Start PluralEyes. PluralEyes is a standalone application.
In the PluralEyes main window, click the Open… button and choose the AAF file that you exported earlier.
Choose any desired sync options (if you’re not sure, just leave them all unchecked) and press Sync.
PluralEyes will create an output AAF file and will tell you where it is.
In Media Composer, import that AAF file. The result will be a copy of  the input sequence but with the clips moved around to be in sync.

It’s nice to see such platform openness in third-party software like PluralEyes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are waiting for new Panasonic camera - AG-AF100. It is is a new single-sensor camera with interchangeable lenses. It’s based on the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) format, using a bayonet style lens mount with 10.6x18.8mm CMOS sensor. The body alone is priced around $5k. We expect to have it at the end of December, this year.
We owned Panasonic Lumix DMC GH1 12.1 Megapixel Digital Camera before,  and we still own Lumix HotRod PL Adapter, which allows 35mm format PL mount cine lenses to be attached. We plan to use it with this camera. The camera records on 2 SD (SD/SDHC/SDXC) cards. Video is recorded in AVCHD format.
Quite exciting product. We have scheduled AG-F100 product training with Jan Crittenden-Livingston (AG-F100 Product Manager) and Bernie Mitchell (Panasonic Consultant) on 11/22/2010.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jan Crittenden-Livingston brought the working prototype of the AF100 to Rule yesterday!
The first impression -- it has a rather light body (2.5lbs), although it looks "stocky". The handle can be removed and the right side grip can be removed, too, leaving a pretty simple cube. It came with a PL adaptor for Zeiss cine lens, rod attachment and Vocas mattebox. Quite a small package.
The camera is easy to set and most menus will be familiar to Panasonic camera users. You have to get used to the lack of rocker switch for zoom on the grip and Start/Stop recording button being on the body.  It has a very nice camera picture, although Jan asked us not to judge it - it is a prototype. Perfect choice for P+S Technik DOF Adapter user? Possibly yes.

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Just came from today's Learning Lab on the new Arri Alexa camera and I'm practically salivating!</div>
<div>The presentation was done by Arri technical sales representative Guenter Noesner who wowed us with the elegant design and seemingly perfect mechanics of the much anticipated Alexa.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was most impressed with how modular and adaptable the camera is.  Arri designed the camera to grow and adapt with time and the changing technological trends.  The Alexa currently records to Sony SXS cards but can be updated to stay current with the fastest recording media.  The robust metal shell of the camera is separated into plates that can be replaced or upgraded. You break a BNC connector on set? No worries! The BNC connectors can be switched out and repaired right on location!</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Alexa boots up in no time and has a customized ventilation system that keeps the camera quiet while recording.  If the camera starts to get loud over time the fan can be replaced easily without having to send the whole unit out for repair.  The Alexa menu system is intuitive and easy to navigate.  I toggled through the camera changing  ASA, Shutter, Frame rates - all by the touch of a button or the turn of a dial.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you haven't had a chance to play around with the Alexa visit the Arri website and check out the Alexa simulator, it's a great way to familiarize yourself with the camera menu - <a href="http://www.arridigital.com/technical/simulator">http://www.arridigital.com/technical/simulator</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Can't wait to see all the amazing footage our clients will be shooting with the new Alexa.  Don't wait another day to get out their and get shooting!</div>

		<title>The New Sony PMW-F3</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sony's most anticipated camera is finally just around the corner with delivery expected mid-February.  The F3 is a dream camera for most in that it offers a large sensor like DSLR's but with the feature sets and ergonomics of a professional HD camera.  The F3 features a Super 35mm-sized sensor and a PL mount adapter.  On the surface, the camera appears to be no more than an EX1R with a large sensor, but, under the covers, it's actually so much more.  Its numerous features will mean more to some than others, but, it's fair to say that Sony has a winner on its hands for both entry level shooters all the way up to seasoned professionals.  Beyond the sensor's increased low-light capability is a huge increase in noise reduction and the forethought of keeping the flange depth (in relation to the sensor) accurate and in-tune for use with most professional motion 35mm Cine Lenses.  Great features like over crank and under crank are present (1fps-60fps), and the camera features the same amazing 3.5" viewfinder as the EX1R.  Even with this great viewfinder, it's advisable to use an on-board monitor since the depth of field is shallower than the EX series and focus will be much more critical.  A good monitor with focus assist is key if not pulling tape on each shot.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sony-PMW-F3BODY.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-593" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sony-PMW-F3BODY-300x277.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="277" /></a>Photo: F3 camera body with PL mount adapter.

I noticed online via various forums, blogs, etc., a lot of confusion about the mount on the F3.  The F3 features a removable PL mount but the camera has its own F3 mount as well.  Many people have asked why there is a zoom rocker on a camera that comes with a PL mount.  The zoom control is specifically for the F3 mount on the body which, in the near future, will be able to control S35mm F3 mount zoom lenses which Sony has plans to bring to market in the near future.  These zooms are the 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 (manual focus and zoom), 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 (auto), and the 17-50mm f/2.8 (auto). These lenses are not due until the end of 2011 and price is TBD.  This is still very encouraging and something that cannot currently be found in the DSLR arena.  S35mm zoom lenses, even in a new F3 mount, are a solution that opens up the use of smaller crews and less external components (microforce, etc.).  Sony has the ability to make lenses like this due to their acquisition of Konica / Minolta.  Outside of the F3 mount the camera comes with a PL mount.  It's not a dummy mount in that it has the ability to transmit Arri Lens Data and Cooke/i data to the camera body.  These data pins are located in the 12 and 3 o'clock positions inside the PL mount. This metadata is passed onto the SxS cards during recording so you have the ability in post to review lens information (think Canon EXIF data with Aperture but with motion pictures).  Sony also has an F3K bundle which features three of its own PL lenses (35mm, 50mm &amp; 85mm) all f/2.0 with 95mm filter diameters.  I think this is a very clever choice to have a bundle with these primes because they are fast, consistent and can be purchased for a lot less than most PL mount cine glass.  Canon and Nikon users are not left out as Nikon (G and DX will all work) and Canon FD lens adapter to F3 mount are available from MTF Services.  Birger Engineering also has plans to release a Canon EF mount with full protocol control.  I think most users will be looking at Zeiss CP.2 PL lenses as an affordable solution for owning, and lens renters will be looking at Cooke S4, Arri and Zeiss PL mount lenses to take full advantage of the amazing sensor on the camera.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pmwf3_front.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-594" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pmwf3_front-251x300.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="300" /></a>Photo: F3 with PL mount. Notice the data pins at the 12 and 3 position in the mount.

The Sony F3 uses SxS cards just like the rest of the Sony PMW series of cameras.  The camera records MPEG-2 Long GOP which is also used by the rest of the XDCAM HD cameras in Sony's professional line.  The bit rate is selectable between the 35 Mb/s @ 1920 x 1080 or 1280 x 720 in HQ mode or 1440 x 1080 if using 25 Mb/s SP mode at all the standard frame rates we are accustomed to with Sony's CineAlta line of cameras (1fps - 60fps).  This was smart on Sony's part as it allows you to inter-cut with other Sony professional cameras in the line if needed. The camera features two SxS slots which can hold up to two 64GB SxS-1A cards for a total of 200 minutes of continuous recording time without having to offload (well beyond DSLR capabilities)

A great feature of the F3, which also has some lack of clarity on the web, is its ability to output Dual Link 3G SDI 10bit 4:2:2 and RBG.  This is an optional feature available in April via a software unlock (price TBD), and it will allow you to use several different recording options like a CineDeck, HDCAM SRW5500/2, Codex, Astro HR-7502, S.Two, direct to AJA Kona 3G (ideally with CineForm DDR), etc.  You can also use a NanoFlash or a KiPro Mini if you just want to bypass the SxS or as a secondary or primary (with SxS as a backup).

With 3D being popular in the past few years, Sony has wisely added a 3D system link option that will allow you to lock-up timecode, genlock and other controls with a single cable -- simplifying the process.  This is really smart because it allows you to use simple side-by-side 3D rigs without the need for external devices, etc.  3D focus, zoom, iris can all be done with a Preston HU3 and 2 x MDR-2 units with 6 motors via 3D tweak in the Preston hand unit. When Sony puts out their own S35 Zoom lens with built in servos this process will be even easier as you can use a Varizoom and other simple electronic controls for FI+Z.  It's also important in that the F3 has an 8pin remote terminal so you can use standard remote units like the RMB150 controller.  I mention this with 3D as it is possible to use one remote to control two cameras with an 8pin adapter cable. The 3D link option will be available in April and price is TBD.

Overall, the Sony F3 is destined to become one of the most talked about and popular cameras of 2011.  With the Panasonic AF100 and the Sony F3, it is safe to say a shift to large sensor cameras by manufacturers is a priority.  Sony and Panasonic have been paying attention and both reacted with two quality products that directly address a number of features and requests that we have all had with DSLRs.  Ergonomics, proper audio (XLR connections with monitoring), proper waveform/vector, recording length, codecs, etc., have all been addressed affordably.  The camera comes with a PL adapter, Stereo Mic, Windscreen, IR remote, Shoulder strap (not sure why), manual, CD-ROM with drivers and digital manual and warranty.  The F3K comes with the same supplied accessories with the addition of the PL lens kit featuring a 35mm, 50mm and 85mm lenses. The camera does not come with batteries or a charger.  Luckily, it uses the Sony BP series of batteries so if you already have an EX1 or EX3, you'll be all set.  These batteries and charger will be sold and rented at Rule along with the Sony PMW-F3 camera.   We'll be hosting a Learning Lab for the F3 on Wed, Jan 19th 2011 at Rule Boston Camera.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rule is now a Zeiss Authorized Dealer so I thought I would take some time to write about some of the new lens options we will be offering in Sales and adding to our existing lens cache in rentals. Available for sale is Zeiss ZE, ZF and Compact Primes CP.2.

First are the Zeiss CP.2 Compact Primes, which are available in PL, Nikon F and Canon EF mount. These are true Cine lenses, with proper focus and iris gears, flare suppression and consistent front diameters (114mm except 50mm Macro 134mm).  They feature calibrated lens scales,  a 14 blade iris and are coated to ensure color matching and rendition. The CP.2's cover full frame so they can be used on a Canon 5D or Nikon 3Ds in addition to the new Sony F3 and Panasonic AF100.  The lenses have interchangeable mounts but this is a bit misleading as you would need to own a collimator to properly align them and shim them. It can be done, but the recommendation is for a service center to do mount changes especially if this business is your livelihood and accuracy is everything.  However, the ability to do this can save you quite a bit as a mount swap is a fraction of the price of an adapter and offers more precision.  Something to keep in mind -- if using with EF or the F mount, you will want to use a lens support system since these lenses are much heavier than DSLR primes. The CP.2's are not a replacement for Ultraprimes or Cooke S4's as they do not have a lens data relay system or linear iris scales, and they are not consistent in regards to their widest aperture T-stop ratings.  The widest focal length is 18mm and the longest is 100mm, so you may need to supplement with an ultraprime if you favor telephoto like a 135mm or 180mm.   CP.2's are affordable and attainable which can't be said for most 35mm Cine lenses.  They make a worthwhile investment if you shoot a lot of commercial or feature work.  If you own an AF100, F3, 1DS Mark IV, you will want to look at these lenses.  I suggest renting them, and I think you will be surprised at the build as well as the uniformity in size and consistency. Focal lengths and stops are 18mm t/3.6, 21mm t/2.9, 25mm t/2.9, 28mm t/2.1, 35mm t/2.1, 50mm t/2.1, 85mm t/2.1, 100mm t/2.1 and a Macro 50mm t/2.1 . The lens focus throw / rotation is approx 300 degrees.  Some of the focal lengths seem odd but I assume this is due to them covering full frame and when used in Motion Picture 35 and S35 there is a crop factor to contend with.  The lenses can be purchased individually or in various sets.

No plastic parts here!

Next is the Zeiss ZF.2 lenses for Nikon DSLR's.  A Canon version of these lenses are in the works.  They come in F mount and are intended for use with Nikon DSLR cameras.  As you probably already know, many are simply using a Fotodiox adapter to use the lenses on Canon 5DMKII, 7D, T2i and IDsMKIV cameras.  The great thing about the ZF.2 lenses is that they feature a manual Iris ring -- manual allows for more control.  Mind you, this will click to engage, so if you plan on racking iris during a shot you will want these detentes de-click by Duclos lenses or another service center to make them more Cine friendly.  These lenses also do auto exposure (if using Nikon camera) by simply closing down to f/16 or f/22 (which ever is marked in orange on the lens) and putting the camera into program AE.  Focus data is not transmitted to the camera.  The main difference between the ZF and the new ZF.2 is that there is a chip in the lens mount that transmits maximum aperture data, aperture range, and exit pupil location as EXIF data.  It does nothing more, but if you shoot Nikon DSLRs its good to have that metadata embedded into your stills.  Not any use for video, unfortunately.  The lenses are affordable and offer a quality build.  They do not feature consistent front diameters, weight or even apertures, but they are fast, lightweight and affordable.  Current focal lengths available are 18mm f/3.5, 21mm f/2.8, 25mm f/2.8, 28mm f/2.0, 35mm f/1.4, 35mm f/2.0, 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.4 and on the macro end 50mm f/2.0 + 100mm f/2.0 . These lenses are a mix of Planar T and Distagon T lenses with all the super wide, wide and Macro's being Distagon's and the standard and telephoto being Planar's.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ZF.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-611" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ZF-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Zeiss ZF.2 85mm f/1.4

Last on the list is Zeiss ZE lenses for Canon DSLR's.  These are the least adaptable, but, if you shoot with Canon's they make a lot of sense as they have electronic exposure control. The properties of the lens are almost exactly the same as the ZF.2 lenses minus the manual apertures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the new Panasonic AF100 Camera being shipped, and the new Sony PMW-F3 on its way, lots of questions have arisen, especially by filmmakers who don’t actually know much about lenses.  I know...seriously?  However if you’re like me and want a simple explanation of what goes with what, here it is below.

We’ve recently established a relationship with Birger Engineering, a well-known company right down the road from us in Boston, and, as of February 10, we'll start carrying their Canon EF to Micro 4/3 Adapter.  Their Birger F-Mount adapter will shortly follow and after that you’ll be seeing adapters for the Sony PMW-F3, which is a native PL-mount, and also the Arri Alexa camera.  Don’t forget we’re having an event this Wednesday, January 19<sup>th</sup> featuring the Sony PMW-F3, currently, only one of two in the entire country.  If you have questions you'd like to ask Sony directly, this will be the event to come to!

So, what next?  Well, please make sure you are stocked on accessories.  We are obviously seeing a delay in the AF100 inventory due to high demand, but note that we now carry stock of SanDisk CF and SDHC Cards, SxS-1 and P2 as well as batteries, chargers, headphones and more.  If there is something you’d like to see more of here, email me at <a href="mailto:Brooks@Rule.com">Brooks@Rule.com</a>, and let me know!  I’ll happily add more to the inventory if I’m missing something.  Tune in for more new things to be expecting- the countdown to NAB is on now that the New Year has begun, and it’s never too late to start tracking what you’ll see.

Below, we have some pictures of an AF100 we recently set up for a client, including the Zacuto Fast Draw, with an extra Zwivel Arm, 4.5 M-F Threaded Rod, 10” Arm Extensions, 77mm step-down ring, Genus 4x4 Matte Box, Arri M-FF1 Follow Focus, Zacuto Zip Gear with stops, Vibesta 8.3” Magic Arm, Canon 24-70mm L-series lens and a Convergent Design Nanoflash.  Accessories?  In this case, Panasonic VWV-BG6PPK batteries and single slot Panasonic charger, Panasonic 32Gb Gold SDHC Cards, SanDisk 32Gb Extreme CF Cards (Class 10) and a Canon Adapter that will be announced shortly. As we were setting this up: One thing to note: When using a non-Panasonic lens with an adapter, go to Menu&gt;Other Functions&gt; Lens Check and turn it “off.” Otherwise you’ll see black.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The forecasters were all gloom-and-doom; the iso-bars were tightening; and the snow shovels were being sharpened (are you supposed to sharpen snow shovels?) - a storm was predicted for Wednesday and it was going to be a biggie.  Would Rule Boston Camera stay open?  Well, John Rule has many mailmen counted amongst his ancestors so there would be no question that we would definitely be open.  But employees like myself who travel from thither and yon face the dilemma of how to get here.  So I had the brilliant solution - never leave!   With a sleeping bag under one arm and a blow-up mattress under another (I have fragile bones - like a bird), I settled down in the Learning Lab and hunkered down for the night.  I can't describe what happened that night but let's just say the spirits of Brighton are restless... and loud ("I'm tryin' to sleep here!").  I emerged the next morning, white and shaken, but ready to handle the phone calls and shovel some snow.  Many of my co-workers also braved the elements and a certain survivor's camaraderie emerged: we swapped tales of digging and scraping but were ready to take on whatever Mother Nature could throw our way and still do business.  And then we had a big snowball fight.  Winter do your worst!

		<title>Sony PMW-F3: Back to Back Events</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=672</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2011 21:28:40 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-medium wp-image-673 alignright" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sony-PMW-F3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />

Yesterday, we here at Rule Boston Camera were graced with the presence of Sony’s new Super35-style HD camera, the PMW-F3. We hosted our own event about the camera as part of our weekly Learning Lab Series, and then the New England chapter of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) held their own meeting about the camera and its technology here in the evening. Sony was kind enough to bring a prototype of the F3 as well as an SXRD 4K projector to show off their new tech. Each event had its own personal flair, but both offered interesting insights into Sony’s new large-sensor offering. I recommend reading Mike Sutton’s <a title="The New Sony PMW-F3" href="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/?p=588" target="_blank">blog post</a> for a more complete and more technical feature description, but I’ll highlight some of the important parts that were featured during Wednesday’s presentations.

The morning Learning Lab event was led by Sony’s Peter Crithary, who took us through the functions of the camera and showed us some truly breathtaking short-form pieces shot by people at USC and Stargate Films. Right off the bat, I have to say the footage looks beautiful. Even with 35Mbit/sec XDCAM EX internal recording, the images hold up well to color grading and compositing. When the camera is attached to an external recording device, though, like an AJA KiPro, Convergent Design’s NanoFlash, or Sony’s own HDCAM SR deck, the imager on this thing really shines. No noise, great depth of field, impressive dynamic range—it has it all. Don’t forget that your lenses can make all the difference in the world! And with the appropriate adaptors, the F3 can use a variety of prime or zoom lenses that are large enough to cover the super35 imager.

Peter’s presentation gave us a ton of information on what the camera can do and how it can be applied to the typical, or sometimes not-so-typical, workflow. Not only does it make pretty pictures, it also gives you functionality to boot. For the absolute highest-possible recording quality, he recommended recording to the internal SxS slots for an off-line version, while simultaneously taking advantage of the 4:4:4 Dual-Link SDI output (with a firmware upgrade, available soon) to an HDCAM SR deck for your on-line edit. Both versions will be in perfect sync and the workflow is totally seamless. You can also take advantage of the additional SD/HD switchable SDI port to run an on-set monitor for your client without the need for headache-inducing distribution amplifiers. You can even apply the Look Up Table (LUT) settings you plan to use in post-production color grading in the camera itself, allowing the DP and the client to see it in its (almost) final form—without affecting your 4:4:4 master. Amazing! This is far more than many people will actually take advantage of, but the scalability here is definitely notable. He also highlighted features like 3D Link, where you can connect two F3’s and with one cable, can control both simultaneously for perfectly-synced 3D shooting.  Check out Peter's Learning Lab session in its entirety on vimeo:  http://vimeo.com/channels/rulelearninglabseries.

While Peter’s presentation was a little more practical, aimed at the average user, Hugo Gaggioni took the reigns at the evening’s SMPTE event and spoke more on the technology behind the F3. He took us all the way back to the 70’s and 80’s when CCD imagers were first developed and discussed the transition to new CMOS technologies up to and including future 4K sensors along with the new Super35mm chip in the F3 itself. While not necessarily for the layman, his presentation was packed with fascinating information on how we got to be where we are now—and how the new chips coming out of Sony’s new manufacturing plant are changing the way we shoot HD, 3D and 4K. The people in attendance even got a sneak peek at some of the new technology Sony will be unveiling this year—very exciting stuff!

The Sony F3 often seems to come up in conversations about the Panasonic AF100 and Canon’s line of DSLR’s. While the size of the sensor on each of these suggests they are all in the same class, this is hardly the case. Each one is designed to fit a certain set of needs and a certain budget. The F3 is in a slightly different price range than the offerings from Canon and Panasonic, but again, the functionality and feature set far outstrip its competition. On the flip side, however, at $16,000 list price, it is much cheaper than both the Red One and Arri Alexa, another set of cameras the F3 is bound to be compared to. What you must do is really evaluate the needs of your shoot and decide which of these cameras best suits your demands and budget.

We were assured that the camera is on schedule to ship in February. We’re all excited about what this camera can do, and I hope you are, too!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Our very own Alexa was the star of a film shooting locally, in New Bedford, MA, this Winter.  "Fairhaven" is a comic drama that tells the story of three childhood friends reuniting in their home town of Fairhaven, MA.  Written and Directed by Tom O'Brien who fell in love with the Massachusetts seaport town and was inspired to set the project there.  The film is being shot by DP Peter Simonite and features stars such as Mad Men's, Rich Sommer, Six Feet Under's, Chris Messina and Deadwood's Sarah Paulson.</div>
<div>We missed our Alexa dearly and we were eager to hear what our friends at Fairhaven thought of the camera.  General Manager Brian Malcolm and myself ventured down to Westport, MA to meet the cast and crew on location at Lee's Market for some grocery store interior shots.  On the way, Brian spotted 4 Red-Tailed Hawks and one male Cardinal.  I tried to play the bird game too but my bird-like findings turned out to be trash bags trapped in branches or bushels of leaves.  (You've won this round, Malcolm!)</div>
<div>When we arrived on the set, we were warmly welcomed by an excited cast and crew.  Everyone raved about the Alexa with its superior image quality and high sensitivity in low light.  The Alexa is rated at ISO 800 but we learned that they were able to get exposures of up to 1600 ISO.  Phrases like "This camera will change the industry forever" and " I never want to work with another camera again" were echoing around us as the crew testified to the camera's cinematic abilities and ease-of-use.</div>
<div>We really enjoyed watching the Fairhaven team in action, and we're looking forward to the film’s release!</div>
<div>For more information about the Fairhaven movie visit their website at <a href="http://www.fairhaventhemovie.com/">www.fairhaventhemovie.com</a>.</div>

		<title>In the Showroom: Sony EX1R &amp; EX3 Savings!</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=729</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the recent influx of large sensor cameras with detachable lenses like Sony's PMW-F3 and Panasonic's AF-100, many people are wondering what the future holds for their PMW-EX1R or PMW-EX3 -- both of which are only a few years old and still going strong.  Sony made adjustments around the new trend by offering a $300 rebate on the EX1R and a $500 rebate on the EX3 with great leasing options.  This isn't meant to dwindle the EX inventory, however, and it's not because the EX series is going out of style, but it's meant to highlight the fact that both are still phenomenal cameras with great features.  In our Sales Showroom, we've seen lots of EX sales activity, and this special rebate offer from Sony is a great opportunity for savings. You won't see a comparable camera like this from Sony anytime soon.

Here's a quick overview of some capabilities of the EX1R/EX3:

1/2" sensor
1080p
24p
HD-SDI
8-pin remote connection
2/3" Lens Capability (EX3 Only)
2 XLR inputs
Interchangeable Lens System (EX3 only)
Dual SxS Express Card Slot
1/33 - 1/2000 shutter speed range

Stop by the Showroom for more details.

		<title>The Phantom Flex High-Speed Digital Camera</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=737</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2011 15:13:48 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Phantom Flex is the latest in HD high-speed image capturing from  manufacturer Vision Research. I have been spending some time testing the  Flex over the past two weeks and I am very impressed. With a 1000 ISO,  the sensitivity this camera allows is far superior to its predecessor  the Phantom HD Gold (ISO 320) which is a superb camera in its own right.  This kind of sensitivity proves beneficial in high-speed image  capturing. With it's capability to capture over 2500fps at 1920x1080,  or over 5000fps at 1280x720, you quickly see why Flex is the most  sensitive high-speed camera on the market today.

[caption id="attachment_741" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="The Phantom Flex"]<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Phantom-Flex.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-741" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Phantom-Flex-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

Another fine feature of the Flex is its internal capping shutter. This  makes black balancing much easier to do during production with the press  of a button on the side of the camera. Because of high operating  temperatures, the sensor needs to be regularly black balanced to  stabilize the signal levels. With this in mind, the camera also has an  optional HQ mode. HQ mode eliminates the need to manually black balance  as it does it automatically within each captured frame. Although HQ  reduces the maximum frame rate capture speeds by approximately one half  than standard mode, it makes for quicker shooting in the field as well  as increases the signal to noise ratio in the image. An improperly black  balanced camera will ruin your shot and that is not an option when you  often have one short opportunity to capture it.

Flex has two recording operation modes to choose from:  Loop mode or Run/Stop mode.
In Loop mode the Flex uses an internal buffer that stores each take. The  duration of the recorded action respectively decreases as the frame  rate increases. So you may only have 2 seconds of capture time to film  that exploding water balloon, or 4 seconds to film that acrobat in  midair.
<em>(Check out RBC client Tom Guilmette's recent blog and Flex footage  for a creative example at <a href="http://www.tomguilmette.com/archives/1986" target="_blank">http://www.tomguilmette.com/archives/1986 </a></em><em>)</em>
The clip in the buffer can then be trimmed and saved to the on-board  CineMag, which is a 128G, 256G, or 512G flash mag mounted to the camera.

[caption id="attachment_739" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Mounting the CineMag onto the Flex"]<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinemag2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-739" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinemag2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

Run/Stop mode allows you to record direct to the CineMag while  avoiding the short time allowed in the buffer. This may be a better  choice when the action is longer or continuous. The caveat here is that  the maximum frame rate is much lower. Maximum frame rate direct to  CineMag is 361fps at 1920x1080. But the bonus is recording for longer  periods of time. The operator can start and stop recording like a  regular camera until the CineMag is full.

The CineMag files are downloaded via Phantom software on a PC, either  while still on the camera or on a Vision Research CineStation. The  files on the CineMag are RAW files with the .cine extension. These are  very large files that take a considerable amount of time to download to  external hard drives to deliver to post. These files can be opened with  software like Glue Tools , or Iridas. Glue Tools opens the files in a  QuickTime wrapper and allows you to edit and view them in Final Cut Pro  or other QT based applications for editing, grading and coloring.

A different approach to saving the Phantom footage is using a video  workflow method, by capturing the video playback directly from the Flex  or CineStation onto a recordable device.

[caption id="attachment_753" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="CineStation"]<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/CineStation_3072x2048.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-753" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/CineStation_3072x2048-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]

Both have dual link HD-SDI  outputs for high quality recording. Popular choices for this may include  the CineDeck Extreme(4:2:2, 4:4:4), Convergent Design's NanoFlash recorder(4:2:2), AJA KiPro(4:2:2)  or KiPro Mini(4:2:2) or direct to a CPU via a video card(4:2:2, 4:4:4). The Flex also has  auto-scaling which allows shooting over-sampled resolution of  2560x1440(16:9) and scaling the SDI output to 1920x1080. Over-sampling  gives us a better quality image (no artifacts) and greater dynamic  range.

[caption id="attachment_742" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Two HD-SDI outputs can be set to dual link 4:4:4 for high-quality image capture"]<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Flex-Rearview2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-742" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Flex-Rearview2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

Rule Boston Camera's Flex comes standard with a PL mount allowing the  use of our entire inventory of 35mm motion picture camera lenses. Super  16 lenses can also be used when operating the Flex at 1280x720.

RBC has 128G and 256G CineMags available for rental with the Flex.

Be prepared for long download times when saving the .cine files from flash mags.

<strong>Flex Max Frame Rates in LOOP mode:</strong>
2560x1440 - SQ: 1617fps , HQ: 802fps
1920x1080 - SQ: 2564fps , HQ: 1267fps

<strong>Flex Max Frame Rates in R/S mode:</strong>
2560x1440 - SQ: 217fps , HQ: 217fps
1920x1080 - SQ: 361fps , HQ: 361fps

<strong>CineMag Recording Time:</strong>
2560x1440 - 128G = 20 minutes@24fps
256G = 40 minutes@24fps

1920x1080-  128G = 33 minutes@24fps
256G = 67 minutes@24fps

<strong>Download Time via 1G Ethernet /PC :</strong>
128G = 1.75 hours
256G = 3.5 hours

The quality of the images Flex creates combined with the super slow motion truly make for stunning cinematography. Often described as "jaw dropping".

		<title>Shooting with the Arri Alexa</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=764</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the privilege of shooting with the Arri Alexa this past weekend for an upcoming web series that I am producing with some former Rule Boston Camera interns, entitled “<a title="Welcome to the World" href="http://w2tworld.com" target="_blank">Welcome to the World</a>.” We were lucky enough to get the Alexa for the weekend and we were able to see what this new camera can really do.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/W2TW-Screenshot-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-766" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/W2TW-Screenshot-2-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

For those of you who don’t know, the Alexa is already receiving quite the hype. Martin Scorsese is shooting his <a title="Hugo Cabret" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/" target="_blank">next feature</a> with it and Roger Deakins has been recently <a title="Forum: True Grit, your last venture with film...for now?" href="http://www.deakinsonline.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1589" target="_blank">discussing his affinity</a> towards the camera--and they’re not alone. The Alexa achieves about 13.5 stops of latitude (in LogC), is natively rated to ISO800 and is insanely easy to use. While it does not sport the 4K resolution that the RED does, its image clarity and post workflow are just some of the advantages to using Arri’s new flagship product.

This was my first large-scale digital production. I come from a Super16 background, and almost all of my larger projects have been shot on Arri 16mm film cameras. I obviously have shot digital before (Canon DSLR’s, primarily, with some experience with the RED One), but never on this scale. We went into the project thinking it would be just something to do for fun, but it became a serious production with a sizable crew and an apartment packed with extras. I’m convinced that as much as I love shooting film, we could not have accomplished what we did (15-page script in 2.5 days!) with anything but digital—and more importantly, without the Alexa.

This is a bold statement, I know, but I will explain. One of Arri’s primary competitors to the Alexa, it seems, is the RED One. The RED is a cheaper option (for the body only, at least), and offers 4K resolution, not just 2K/1080p.  However, in my opinion, the complications that arise from shooting such high resolution far outweigh the benefits. In my subjective opinion, the RED certainly looks nice, but has a tendency to look “too real” or electronically sharpened. This is a side effect that I think many digital cameras suffer from, one that has long been an arguing point for the superiority of film. The Alexa, on the other hand, shoots a very clear image, but it doesn’t look overly sharp or introduce any artifacts. The Alexa paired with a set of Cooke S4 primes, like we had, yields an astounding picture, but in my opinion, doesn’t look hyper-real. There is still texture in the image and it’s not unnaturally clean. We chose not to shoot LogC (I'm no professional colorist!), which provides an even greater dynamic range and more flexibility in post. We shot Rec709 and still got amazing images straight out of the camera.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/W2TW-Screenshot-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-765" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/W2TW-Screenshot-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>

The Alexa was also instrumental in our production because of its ease of use both physically and in software (ever seen the menu system on the RED??). We had several shots that required challenging camera moves, and almost everything was handheld. Sure, the camera is heavy compared to a Sony EX3 or even the new F3, but it’s lighter than a fully-built RED rig and is certainly more ergonomic. Having a large, accessible handle on top, built-in shoulder pad and rod support and an all-in-one body design made our handheld shots extremely easy. While the modular design of the RED affords it a considerable amount of flexibility, it can become dauntingly large for handheld shots, especially. We had one particularly challenging shot that started upside down, pointed into a trash can. It then spun around and up onto the DP’s shoulder, where he then walked backward to reveal the room we were in. We stripped the camera to its bare essentials—the body, lens and rods both for a handgrip and to support a Bartech remote follow focus. We had one person holding a Panasonic BT-LH900 so we could remove the viewfinder, another person spotting the DP and another wrangling power and HD-SDI so we could eliminate the onboard battery and so I could pull focus from another monitor in the adjacent room. Even if we stripped the RED down, I believe it would still have more difficult to successfully accomplish the shot with that camera.

Since this was a still a relatively small shoot and I will be editing the project, I was also in charge of media management on set. It could not have been easier. The Alexa records to Apple ProRes on Sony SxS media, so loading your footage is as easy as popping the card into an external reader, or in my case, my MacBook Pro’s ExpressCard slot (NOTE: My laptop is 2 years old and NOT the unibody design, so I still have the card slot on the 15” model. The new 15” unibody design does NOT include ExpressCard, but the 17” does). Once the card was in, we could instantly watch the footage directly from the Mac OS X Finder or QuickTime. I went the easy route and made disk images of each card using the Disk Utility application that comes pre-loaded on every Mac. Just for safety/ease, I also just dragged-and-dropped the individual .mov files onto my external RAID 1 drive (ideally, we would have used something like <a title="ShotPut Pro" href="http://www.imagineproducts.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=2" target="_blank">ShotPut Pro</a> to copy the data). As with any large digital production, I would highly recommend having a dedicated Digital Imaging Technician on set to handle media and all additional imaging needs. But in our case, since we could not get a proper DIT and because the Alexa was so easy to use, we were willing to take the risk of not having a DIT. This is not something you could reasonably do when dealing with 4K footage out of the RED. And now that we’re in post-production, I can either load those files directly into Final Cut for editing, or even use Avid Media Access to edit the ProRes footage natively in Avid Media Composer 5. Easy as pie.

Now let me be clear: while I’m comparing the RED and the Alexa, they are both very different products with different markets in mind. If you need to shoot RAW and get 4K imaging, the RED will obviously be the way to go. It’s also a slightly more cost-effective solution for some situations. But if you want something that you can get beautiful images with right off the bat in a lightweight, ergonomic package with a streamlined post-production workflow, then you should absolutely consider the Arri Alexa. It’s a wonderful piece of hardware and as far as I’m concerned, my new favorite camera.

		<title>Arri ALEXA 3.0 Software Update</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=781</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2011 14:36:24 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Exciting news here at RBC is that Arri, keeping with their promise of delivering updates for ALEXA, have recently released version 3.0 which now allows  video playback of the clips from the SxS media cards, audio recording via the 5 pin XLR stereo input and embedded in the HD-SDI outputs, and max 3200 ASA.

Push the PLAY soft button on the camera side, and scroll through the clips to select one. Push the knob and your viewing your footage on all outputs. A future update will allow audio to play back as well, but for now this is another step in the right direction from Arri.

With ALEXA's multiple output and record options, 3.0 has made it easier to independently select each output/record path gamma setting. For example; record LogC to SxS cards while outputting Rec709 from HD-SDI outputs. All easily accessible from the lcd without going into the menu hierarchy. The Rec709 color processing has also been improved from last version. If you do choose to record LogC to SxS , Arri has made available a LUT generator (Look Up Table) on their website for downloading LUT's and applying them to footage in post.

The viewfinder has an optional Smooth mode which reduces flicker in the viewfinder at 30fps and under. A much more pleasant viewing experience but this will not be the same as all other outputs which will still have motion flicker in respect to frame rates.

False Color Check can be activated in the viewfinder and/or the monitor output path. False Color Check is an exposure level guide using different colors to relay different exposure levels in your picture. This is helpful as it's the only exposure guide in the camera. Where traditional video and HD cameras have Zebra settings or spot meters, ALEXA is based on setting an ASA and measuring for that sensitivity. A more traditional film method.

[caption id="attachment_784" align="alignnone" width="527" caption="False Color Map (From ALEXA manual 3.0)"]<img class="size-full wp-image-784  " src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/false_color.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="128" />[/caption]

Metadata can be set via the lcd which includes production info like director, cinematographer, location, and user info that could include scene names,etc. The data is saved with the ProRes files making it available post.

Single Frame Grab is a nice function that will store the current frame in the Rec Out path to the cameras SD card as 1920x1080 Jpeg, Tiff, or Dpx files.

Thanks to Arri for keeping the updates coming and ALEXA evolving. The camera will continue to produce exceptional images with amazing latitude into the future.

		<title>In The Showroom: PMW-F3, Ki-Pro Mini,  Zeiss CP.2 &amp; More!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love the smell of fresh styrofoam and cardboard.  Especially since that's all I've been smelling for the last 4 days as I open up a new PMW-F3, KiPro Mini, Pan. AF-100, Marshall HDMI 5" monitor, Zeiss ZF.2's (18, 28, 35, 50, 85mm), Zeiss CP.2 (28, 35mm). Not so bad. Pair these diesel items with some custom Zacuto rigs, which I've been building lately (and which are the equivalent of grown-up legos) and you've got a set-up made specifically for you.  These items are so new and so popular that they're challenging enough to use successfully without being overrated.  We've been sending AF-100's and F3's out to high-end freelancers, art schools, film schools, and pro feature film production sets.  They fit in anywhere if you can take advantage of the features that they offer.  Rule has recently become a Zeiss dealer and we're pairing the latest Zeiss lenses with many of our cameras along with the Canon lensing and optional stock lensing from both Sony and Panasonic.  I just recently used an 18mm ZF.2 with the 60D last weekend up in Maine, but that's a blog post for another time!

Some questions have recently come up about lensing options for these cameras, specifically the F3 and AF-100, and, luckily, we'll have some answers at this Wednesday's 3/2 Learning Lab when Birger Engineering visits with their new Canon 4/3 to EF adapter which will be out in April.    As the Spring goes on, you'll see lots of new announcements pending NAB.  I've included some pictures below of the F3 with the Mini Ki-Pro and CP.2.  Enjoy!

Also, stay tuned -- Mike Sutton is taking the F3 out with a Zeiss CP.2 this weekend, and I'm sure you'll see a blog post from him sometime soon!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's my favorite season again- Film Fest Time! Rule Boston Camera supports a number of film festivals in New England, one of them being the Martha's Vineyard Film Fest, which was held from last Thursday to this past Sunday and was in one word -- AWESOME.  It was extremely well organized and the most enjoyable one I've been to yet.  I was privileged to watch (3) films during my stay - "How to Die in Oregon", addressing Doctor-assisted suicide, "I Am" by Director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty) exploring the world's greatest minds with deep questions and personal revelations, and "We Still Live Here," about the Wampanoag Indian's reviving their ancient language and making it a part of everyday life after over 100 years of silence.  Most films had Q&amp;A afterward, which, to me, is one of the props of the FF's -- being able to hear insight on editing, shooting challenges, etc.  It was fun to see lots of people with Rule Boston Camera hats walking around, and much thanks to Molly Purves, who made my stay (and everyone else's) comfortable and easy.  Free (good) catered food with the movies, so if you are thinking of going to this fest in the future, you are literally looking at a $16 ferry ticket, hotel and movie tickets. A fairly cheap weekend, if you ask me and well-worth the trip.  Next year should be interesting, as Martha's Vineyard has expressed a desire to build a facility strictly for films.  Personally, I hope they keep the 12 couches in back of whatever they build because that may be the greatest decision to date. If you want to look at more, follow me on Twitter @michelle_brooks and @ruleboscam and see my opinion of the films this weekend.

		<title>Anticipating another big year at NAB 2011</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=817</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NABshow_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-830" title="NABshow_logo" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NABshow_logo-300x64.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="64" /></a>

It is always nice to have an annual event that allows manufacturers to step up and focus their energy on bringing new and innovative products to light.  It is also great that so many of us - the users and evangelists of these products - get to participate in this process.  NAB is an opportunity for all of us to offer opinions and insights relative to our own spheres of expertise and influence.  I have seen over the years that we do impact in a positive way how this collective system adapts and changes.

The devastation in Japan has such sad human consequences that I hope  that we don't get too selfish and just talk about how hard tape is to  get or how to capitalize on "market fluctuations".  At the same time I  must be on the lookout for ways to overcome the impending media drought  which we have not yet seen truly strike us.

I am enthused about new releases from Adobe and Avid and I expect Apple rumors and facts to preoccupy much of our time.

Storage continues to be an important part of what we do and I hope to meet up with many innovators that have figured out how to make the digital asset laundrymat a cool place to hang out.

It is becoming more important for all of us to not put off safekeeping of our growing file-based camera originals along with all of the iterations for the edit process and for delivery.  I sometimes feel like Chicken Little warning of impending doom if you don't invest in smart and safe storage.  If we undervalue how to access and restore valuable content along with intelligent searching and tagging we will someday learn the hard way that the current way was often too risky and shortsighted.

I would like to say that I am interested in seeing the latest in 3D (including recent announcements by GoPro 3D and Cineform) but I can't say that I will be  preoccupied with it.  Not all production markets are demanding 3D and I think  New England has been hesitant to jump in - although we at Rule are well prepared to  assist and deliver 3D solutions for anyone interested!

As always, much of NAB is meeting with people and I hope to meet many new faces along with good friends that reemerge year after year.

By the way, here's a hint - Be on the lookout for some exciting new announcements from Rule that may take some by surprise!

Hope to see you on the show floor!

		<title>Apple Predictions for NAB 2011</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/apple.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-832" title="apple" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/apple.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="247" /></a>

We all give Apple credit for keeping the lid on information regarding new products or even new announcements.

So since I don't have any direct knowledge to NOT pass along I thought I would do what everyone likes to do - guess!

I suspect that Apple may offer a new paradigm for media collection, assembly, and dispersion.  I don't know if all of us will like it but I suspect that Apple is about to make media social.

I also wonder if Thunderbolt will electrocute the need for larger workhorse desktop computers or if Apple does still enjoy being in the traditional "heavy iron" computer business.  My hope is that a Mac Pro ergonomic redesign is in the works that will become the next must have Media Manipulator.

Native camera formats will trivially exist outside the sphere of QuickTime and I suspect that H.264, AVCHD and many others will just play and edit with the right computer and graphics cards.

We will continue to discuss the emotion and feel of anything new that Apple brings us.  Bits and bytes are part of the equation but if Apple continues to value and respect the creation community (which I suspect they do) I hope to see some real tactile interfaces that leverage the other consumer technologies such as the iPad and iPhone.

Finally, I  predict that many of these predictions will be predictably preposterous unless they are perfectly punctilious.

		<title>Sony FS100 Camera (NXCAM Super 35)</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=866</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got a look at the new Sony Super 35mm FS100 camera recently, and I was relatively impressed- especially when the lights were turned off and the gain was tuned slightly to reveal a fresh crisp picture, with skin tones and blacks intact.

Granted, this was with a Sony E-Alpha mount and Zeiss 85mm lens with a 1.4 F-stop, but still...  It was music to my eyes.  With a price range of $5,800 list for body only, it's not made to be the F3, but could easily serve as a B-camera.  Actually, the gain level is better than the F3.

I'll keep this short and sweet so that hopefully your questions are answered quickly:

Inputs:
Comp/RCA video (L, R)
USB out
(2) XLR, one on the back of the camera, one on the right side
AVCHD, 28mbps
remote
LANC
clean HDMI out w/ LCD setting in menu "turned on"
1080/60i/24p
720/60i

Does not have:
ND Filters
iLINK
Timecode Out
720/24p

Special Features:
Tripod screw inputs on both the bottom and side of the camera
Ability to use the FMU128 hardrive (List $800) for 10 Hours nonstop footage
LCD screen on TOP center of the camera, 180-degree turn angle
Optional Viewfinder (same hardware as EX3)
Expanded Focus button
Auto Iris (with E-mount lens lens)
Peaking
Interesting -- included hot shoe mounted mic holder, looks like a handle, fairly sturdy, I wouldn't use it as a handle if I had a choice... which I do. You'll likely see 3rd party handles start coming to market pretty soon.

And finally:
Adapters:
Currently Available:
NOVAFLEX- E-Nikon F
MTF                E-Canon FD
MTF                E-PL
MTF                E-Nikon G (manual iris control on adapter)
SONY              E-Alpha
16x9                 E- PL

On their way:
Birger Eng.    E-Canon EF
Hotrod            E-PL

These are expected around the time that the camera starts shipping June-July however nothing is set in stone

(4) Sony E-mount lenses coming out this year, (3) more coming out next year

The stock lens that comes with it is an F/3.5 Stop fully zoomed in.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s nice to be back in Massachusetts following the heat of Orlando at this year’s InfoComm Show.  The show was great and provided opportunities for learning new skills from other industry professionals, exposure to the cutting edge of what technologies are available now in AV installation and continuing positive relationships with manufacturers.

This year’s show focused on a few things that we at Rule Boston Camera already do well.  There was talk about the move in our industry away from providing products and towards providing services.  We go into most of our jobs assuming that all of your perspective installers can get you the same equipment that we can.  What sets us apart needs to be our attention to detail and the ongoing relationship that we have in providing not only the gear you want but the "Engineering Services" you need.

The product category that seemed to have some buzz behind it this year was digital signage.  I agree with many of the presenters at the show, that in the next year to three years, who is using digital signage, and how they are using it will change dramatically.  New products at a wide range of vertical markets and price points can meet this need.  It is our goal at Rule to ride this wave since we already started surfing it!  We will take what we have learned from our clients who are already running digital signage and from those running bulletin boards on their PEG stations in order to offer a full range of products along with our engineering expertise to find the right solution for each customer’s need.

Each year at this show, I learn more and more of what else is out there.  I am looking forward to implementing much of what I saw and to returning next year to learn more of what I have not even thought of yet.

Director of Engineering Services]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lots going on In The Showroom these days.  Much of it consists of rendering footage on the showroom comp and loading the new Adobe 5.5, Apple Final Cut X and updating our Avid.  If you’re not familiar with that software and are considering an upgrade, you should come by and ask us your questions.

What we have in stock and ready to go is exciting. We’ve got lots of new Sennheiser headphones, tons of SxS, CF, SDHC, and P2 Cards, plenty of different speeds to fit whatever camera/recorder you are working on, custom Zacuto rigs, Canon lenses and DSLR’s, and…ta da…the Sony FS100 and F3 cameras (which, yes, we do have in stock... just raring to go and definitely ready to be your latest experience!).

We’ll be running a sale on Ki Pro Mini’s, so if you attend any of our August Learning Labs, stop by the Showroom for a look-see!  This sale will only be running for a short time, so if this is something that you’ve been thinking about purchasing, please let us give you a quote.  We also have an interesting addition of Porta Brace bags. This is an experiment on my part--since it is easy to go online and see all sorts of bags that you are curious about, but, if you are like me and need to see it and touch it, well -- now you can!  We have sack packs, Cable bags, small DSLR bags, airplane bags for traveling, backpacks, ect.  If there is something you’d really like to see in here, let me know!

I’ll make it happen.

Sincerely,

Your Neighborhood Salesperson,

Brooks]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Firmware Upgrade for Ki Pro Mini</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=904</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The new firmware upgrade from Aja for Ki Pro Mini V.2.6.0 is now available.  This upgrade fixes an existing problem with CUSTOM CLIP TAKE by removing this menu parameter altogether.

What's also good about this upgrade is that it adds new functionality by enabling the RED Epic, RED One and certain Canon XF cameras to pass metadata directly to Ki Pro Mini via a single SDI cable.

The update is designed to streamline the workflow between Ki Pro Mini and REDs or Canon's high-resolution imagery on set and in post.

		<title>Early Sneak Peak at the Panasonic AG-HPX250</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=909</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2011 02:49:17 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last few days we at Rule Boston Camera have been evaluating the forthcoming Panasonic AG-HPX250.

As a matter of fact, I think we may be among the very first in the country to get our hands on it and we are happy to pass along our first impressions.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/250.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910" title="250" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/250.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="286" /></a>

Working with Jason Potz, one of our engineers here at Rule, we setup the camera at one of our camera test stations.  We decided to throw the HPX170 camera next to it for comparison.

For those who may not be aware, the HPX170 essentially an HVX200A but without the DV tape mechanism.  The 170 / 200  share a lower effective resolution imager of 1.1 million active pixels with a spatial offset but the new HPX250 offers what is often called a Full HD imager of 2.2 million pixels!

It is also worth noting that packed inside this Compact HD styled camcorder is the very impressive 4:2:2 10-bit sampled  AVC-Intra 100 codec.   To date, this higher quality recording has been reserved for "full sized" ENG type camera bodies costing thousands of dollars more.

On the surface, you could consider the AG-HPX250 a replacement for the very successful and respected HVX200A but with several important improvements that I have outlined below.

Here are some of the key improvements over the HVX200A or HPX170:
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;">Longer 22x lens but with the same 3.9mm wide angle as the HPX170
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;">Full HD 1920x1080 1/3” 3-MOS 2.2 Million pixel (times three) imager
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;">Timecode and Genlock connectors via BNC useful for multicam studio shooting
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;">10-bit, 4:2:2 AVC-Intra 100, AVC-Intra 50, DVCPro HD &amp; Standard Definition record options </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Gill Sans;">720p or 1080i
</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Gill Sans;"> </span>

After looking at the body size, lens, menu system, external connectivity and price, it seems to me that this is a very smart camera choice for Public Access, Education, and Government customers that desire a fairly low cost solution that can easily perform dual duty as both a studio camera by day and a roving compact HD camcorder by night.

		<title>Shooting with the New Panasonic HPX250 AVC-Intra 100 Camcorder</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the unique opportunity last weekend to be one of a select few to shoot with Panasonic's new AG-HPX250 AVC-Intra  100 camcorder in a real-world environment.  The camera has a familiar look to it with a body style similar to the cameras it's replacing (the HPX170 and HVX200).  The main difference between these three cameras is that the 250 adds the AVC-Intra 100 codec. The HPX170 has been around since 2008 so the 250 keeps the line fresh with other features like a 21 x optical zoom vs. a 13 x.  Another change is, of course, the sensor which is now a 2.2 million pixel 3MOS vs. the HPX170's CCD.  Panasonic also decided to jump into the Event and PEG TV markets by adding Genlock and Time-Code interfaces.  A major jump-up in viewfinder quality was also very evident on the HPX250 with over 1 million pixels vs. the 170s 235k.  Although the sensor size is still 1/3", I did notice better detail in the shadow areas of the images I was recording.   I imagine this was because I was using AVC-Intra 100.

<a href="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/HPXsteadi21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-917" src="http://bostoncamera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/HPXsteadi21-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" /></a>

I used the camera for approximately 4 hours on one of my Steadicam Flyer LE HD rigs for a Range Rover training video that I'm shooting.   The camera was originally going to be used for BTS shots, but our regular camera package did not have all the components ready to go, so the HPX250 quickly became the "A" camera for the shoot.   Without having time to read the manual, I was able to quickly get the camera set-up and ready to shoot as time was of the essence.  Panasonic has nicely laid out the key features with quick and easy access to buttons on the operator side of the camera.  Everything you need -- like focus assist, ND, audio controls, scene file, waveform, etc., is nicely placed in plain view.

Once the shoot was done and it was time to edit, the AVC-Intra 100 footage easily loaded into all three of the edit systems I use (and tested it with).  Final Cut Studio, Premiere Pro CS5.5 and Avid MC5.5 and even FCP X worked nicely.  The AVC-Intra 100 held up a little better in post than a few samples I shot in DVCPRO 100, especially when cropping into the image.

If you are in the market for a DVCPRO HD or AVC-Intra 100 camcorder, the Panasonic HPX250 is affordable at under $6k.  It's definitely worth checking out.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With all of these shoulder mounts getting put together, most of my customers are finding that they need more than one shoe mount. And with all of those extra screw holes in the FS100, might as well put them to good use, right? So here you have the top shoe mounts that I’ve found to be most useful. I’m well aware there might be others out there that are working excellently, and if so I would love to add them to this collection.  I would also love feedback about which of these works best for you, the customer. So please, if you read this and so desire, email me at <a href="mailto:Brooks@Rule.com">Brooks@Rule.com</a> these three things:

1.    Which would you buy for the price and usability?

2.    Is this an item that would be useful for Rule to stock?

3.    Which would you find yourself using the most?

		<title>The Canon EOS C300 and Project Imagin8ion&#039;s WHEN YOU FIND ME really had an impact on me..</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[-

How do I begin...

I just watched <em><a title="when you find me" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Imagination" target="_self">When You Find Me</a></em>, which made its debeut a few days ago as part of Canon's Project Imagin8ion.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1006" title="Projectimagin8tion" src="http://staging.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Projectimagin8tion-300x87.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="87" /></p>
Described as a Hollywood short film inspired by 8 winning photographs chosen by Ron Howard and Directed by Bryce Dallas Howard, <em>When You Find Me</em> was shot with Canon's soon to be released Cinema EOS C300 camera.

As a father of two daughters, similar in age to the girls in this film, and husband to a wife who I would never want to be without, I will publicly admit, it moved me -tears and all!  And, I think, for all the <em>right</em> reasons.

Within one minute, I totally forgot why I was actually watching it (which was to study how the Canon EOS C300 actually performed ) and I was completely enshrouded in the story, the characters, the mood - everything.  I felt so much, for what the girls were feeling, for what parents feel for their children, and how each of us carries our own fear, hope, regret, and ultimately, relief.  I was quickly overwhelmed by simultaneous emotions... it was powerful, I didn't expect it at all.

This short film simply reminded me why I went into this business in the first place!

My apologies for being sappy on this post.  That said - Thank you Ron Howard, thank you Bryce, and thank you to everyone involved in this project - especially our friends at Canon!

Picture this... I am sitting in a staff meeting and I see, through the glass door, a cart with 4 cardboard boxes from Fed Ex roll by headed my way.

I know that I am expecting a delivery of 4 Canon C300 cameras for our Special January Pub Night with Larry Thorpe.

For those of you not aware, Larry is Senior Director of Professional Engineering and Solutions at Canon.  He will be presenting  an overview of the C300  followed by Q&amp;A.  By the way, if you are interested in joining us,  it goes from 6-8pm.  and you can RSVP to events@rule.com

Just like a kid on Christmas day, I rush to open these boxes.  I was fortunate to be invited by Canon to attend their grand unveiling in Hollywood on Nov. 3rd so I already had my hands on the camera but I knew that today, I would be able to spend some real time tinkering with these and in quantity!

We received two EF mount and two PL.  We will be showing them in various configurations - from bare bones DSLR-like handheld configs to fully built-up studio style cinema rigs with Optimo zoom cinema lenses.

Very shortly I will follow this up with a more detailed blog about my observations, but in summary, the C300 is a winner for sure!  It is elegant, logical, sturdy and tight.  Its modular design does not feel like you are taking apart a child's toy and the more I played with it the more I understood that a lot of consideration was given to each module.

The pistol grip side handle has a 4 pin electronic connector cable that plugs in before you set your angle for mounting. The mount itself is a very sturdy metal thread which gives you confidence in its reliability.

The menu and controls are straightforward in intuitive.  You have options to label in ISO or Gain, Shutter in Degrees or fractions, White balance  presets displayed in iconic sun or light bulb form or in kelvin (K)

The base sensitivity is shown at [850], for use when utilizing Canon Log, and as most of you have already heard it goes up to an astounding 20,000 ISO!  This of course doesn't mean that you should always shoot this way nor does it mean that there is no amplifier noise but when the judgement of "acceptable"  is yours to make for some shots, its is nice to know you've got it when you need it.

The EF mount with one of our 24-70 EF lenses looked great and of course an Optimo on the PL version looks stunning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At tonight's Pub Night, we'll be introducing an exciting new Electronic Viewfinder made by TV Logic and distributed by Alphatron that will be available at NAB 2012.  You can see the basic specs below, and more information will be released monthly.

EVF 035W-3G Electronic Viewfinder, available Spring 2012.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stats: </span>

3.5” Display 960x640

HD-SDI loop through

HDMI in/out

1080P

Headphone Jack

Focus Assist

Each month between now and then we will release updates with new product features.  TV Logic and Alphatron came up with the idea for the new EVF at last year’s NAB and have spent this year working together to develop and fine-tune it.  Rene van der Reiden of Alphatron describes the relationship between Alphatron and TV Logic as, “a good combination with many factors, so this combination hopefully will be very successful in the time to come.”

We encourage you to ask us questions about this new product!  We'll channel them to Alphatron in order to get answers and to let them know what kind of feedback we're hearing from our customers about the product so far.  The EVF035W-3G Viewfinder will not be available through TV Logic or Alphatron online.  The product will only be available through product resellers.  The list of resellers has not been announced yet, but Rule Boston Camera is one of them, and we look forward to answering your questions and telling you more about the viewfinder.  The EVF will list for a price of $1,395 which is also Minimum Advertised Price.  As a company that has had good experiences with TV Logic products in the past, we agree with Rene’s statement that, ‘what is important is how they handle problems and how they support you.  We have been working with them for the last 4 years and have an excellent relationship not only business to business, but person to person. Here, we are very excited because we know a little more than everyone else does and it will be a brilliant product, I’m sure.  It’s [a company to customer] win-win.’

		<title>Canon C300 Pub Night With Larry Thorpe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I would like to thank all of those who joined us for Canon's C300 event last night.  It was very well attended with a record 150 guests at our popular Pub Night series.  It was great to see a crowd of seasoned professionals eager to learn about the exciting new cinema camera offered by Canon.  As always, the night began with an excellent selection of  pizza and beer, but the floor was quickly handed over to Canon's Larry Thorpe, an industry veteran who is one of the masterminds behind the development of the C300.  He was, by far, the best candidate to give the presentation.  He led the audience through many exciting specifications on the camera including its new Super 35mm sensor designed from the ground up with its native 850 iso sensitivity.  For a great list of specs on the camera you can visit <a class="wp-oembed" href="http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/resources/misc/cinemaEOS_faq.shtml" target="_blank">Canon's EOS web page</a>.  Larry also showed various Canon-funded projects that were commissioned to highlight the range and resolution of the new camera.  The projects clearly show that the C300 promises to be a very important cinematic tool for filmmakers.

We had four C300s on display (two with EF mounts and two with PL mounts) with one set-up to record Larry's presentation.  Afterward, all hands were on the demo C300 models which were configured in various handheld and studio setups.  It was a great opportunity for everyone to push buttons, prod accessories, focus lenses and ask questions. Although the cameras will be returning to Canon, we expect to have another unit in-house soon for those of you who may have missed the event.

We are actively working with Canon to finalize a dealership agreement for the C300 which would place us in a newly-formed Canon group titled "Professional Production System Dealers". The group was formed not only to support the C300 but also to reinforce Canon's commitment to produce future cinema cameras and lenses.  I am very excited about our developing relationship with Canon and all that it promises to bring to our clients.  I will, of course, keep you posted.

We should have pricing and delivery info by January 17th.  If you are thinking about purchasing a C300 please consider talking to us first.  We are here to support you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1466.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1055" title="C300PL On the Bench with Menu" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1466-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coming off of our hugely successful Pub Night here at Rule Boston Camera last Thursday night, I finally have a few minutes to sit down and pass along my initial observations of the Canon C300 and C300PL cameras.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>MODULAR DESIGN &amp; ERGONOMICS
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I first got to handle the C300 in November, I did not know if a modular design would be better than a single integrated design.  The first thing that comes to mind is that the bits and pieces, or modules as I have been calling them, could easily get misplaced if you were spending too much time setting up and breaking down "stuff" for any given shot.   I have started to reconsider this opinion thinking that different users and different productions might configure the camera to satisfy the shooting style rather than to satisfy the  shot.  That said, I tried adding some modules onto the camera and throwing it into a camera bag to see how much stuff could be left on without much fuss.  It is a bit tall rather than long (depending on the lens) but with a simple tripod plate screwed onto the camera I found that I could move from tripod to handheld to and then to camera bag just by removing the LCD module.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will have to look into camera bag options that are a bit more "bowling ball bag" shaped...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know that we will see lots of 3rd party accessories shortly so stay tuned!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In its most stripped down state, you simply pop in a Canon 955 battery, side grip and a lens and you can shoot using the small EVF and no microphone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1406.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1057  aligncenter" title="C300 EF lens and side grip" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1406-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From there you can attach the LCD module which also gives you 2 XLR connections and media playback controls.  There is a shotgun mic holder on this module as well.  The module connects via two 20 pin limo connectors that appear to be totally unique.  These connectors provide signals for the LCD and controls as well as to the XLR mic/line audio inputs.  This is a small 1/8th mini mic connector on the camera body as well but I suspect that may be limited in quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1416.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1056  aligncenter" title="C300 LCD controls" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1416-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally Canon provides a handle which can be used with or without the LCD module.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1415.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1064" title="C300 With LCD and Handle" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1415-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>LENS MOUNTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
Very simply, when you purchase or rent the Canon C300 you have to commit to either the EF lens mount version, called the C300, OR you have to commit to the PL lens mount version called the C300PL.  Canon deliberated this for quite some time before concluding that a super-accurate and mechanically sound lens mount was more important and beneficial to the user than in interchangeable adapter solution.  I agree with this when you consider that sacrificing tight design for flexibility and a broader audience may reduce the camera's performance.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1397.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1060" title="C300 PL Mount Close Up" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1397-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>XF CODEC</strong></p>
Factoids on paper sometimes appear more powerful and important than they actually are.  Since 100 is a larger number than 35, 100 must be "better", right?   Of course, the word "better" has no context and is very misleading.  This was often first sentence in a much more in-depth video signal compression discussion (but I digress).

The Canon 4K imager does a fantastic job delivering a full 1920x1080 resolution for the Red and Blue components and actually delivers 2 channels of 1920x1080 Green in such a way to minimize moire and retain a super sampled luminance signal.   This full 4:4:4 signal is offered to the signal processing engine.  Ultimately from there the signal is fed to both the HDSDI and HDMI outputs as well as to the compression engine packaged as 8-bit.  In-camera recording to CF cards is up to 50Mbits/sec 4:2:2 wrapped in MXF.

Some people are concerned that 8-bit is not as good a 10-bit and, in a vacuum, this is true.  Most of the current in-camera recorders out there encode an 8-bit signal of some type.  Some external records can be setup to record a 10bit signal but it depends on the CODEC.

While demoing the C300 to a large group at WGBH the other day it was wisely pointed out that HDCAM is also an 8-bit recording format and HDCAM is the delivery format of choice for what we see every day for PBS broadcasting.

Like most things, you be the judge of what is objectionable and what is water cooler speculation.
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>MENUS</strong></p>
I will devote a future blog entry  to the C300 menu structure but I can say that the interface was very intuitive and familiar.  The menu can be superimposed on the EVF, the LCD or the external outputs.   In the case of the external connectors you do not get all superimposed info such as  WFM, VECT or some other items.  There is also a very handy rear display below the EVF that gives you access to ISO/Gain, White Balance, and shutter angle.  I found this to be the place where I would quickly choose the Function button and toggle between and change these core settings.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1391.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1062" title="C300 rear controls" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/EV0G1391-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>

		<title>Developing High-Speed with the TS3Cine</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1069</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not breaking news that we have been waiting for a viable model of the much-lauded TS3cine to walk in our door.  For the past 18 months, we have been working closely with the engineers at Fastec Imaging to develop an affordable, portable, DSLR-esque, high-speed camera.  The wish list for the camera has been daunting: a stand-alone camera that will go anywhere and provide 720 HD resolution up to 720 fps, internal processing and storage capability, EF and PL mounts, a large high-resolution color LCD viewfinder while being lightweight and portable, and, finally, with the no-nonsense feel of a DSLR.  The TS3 has been a challenge in the making, and we have been along for the ride (virtually on the edge of our seats) waiting for the first unit to arrive.

Matt Kearney at Fastec arrives today with the camera (with fmount).  We'll post some photos later today and updates as they develop.  In the meantime, join us for Wednesday's, January 11th Learning Lab at 10am.  Tom Talbot will have the TS3Cine prototype and provide an overview of the camera's capabilities.

		<title>Smart Storage for the Digital Age</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For some time now, Rule Boston Camera has been working hard to become the leader in New England of shared storage, digital asset management and archiving. As the industry moves away from tape and into file-based media, safely and intelligently storing your digital video files has become increasingly important. Our goal in this “Smart Storage Initiative” is to provide the best possible solutions for each customer’s needs—from the one-man-band all the way up to the enterprise-level customer.

Naturally, a significant part of this initiative is education and not just for our customers. Recently, we have been putting our vendors' shared storage products through rigorous testing to see which products fit perfectly with which workflows. No single product, be it from Avid, Facilis, SNS or Apple/Promise, is right for every need or for every customer. We’re doing speed tests, checking compatibility with third-party software, figuring out how you can use each one in collaborative workflows (and more) in order to find how each shared storage product shines and in which areas. The end result:  when you tell us about your business and your needs, we will be able to confidently recommend a product that will be a perfect fit for you and your workflow as well as your budget.

While shared storage products like Apple XSAN/Promise V-Trak, Facilis Terrablock, Avid ISIS and SNS EVO are a significant part of the puzzle, we also provide solutions for digital asset management and archiving with products like CatDV from SquareBox and the Cache-A line of products among others. Don’t need or can’t afford a large shared storage system or LTO-5 backups? We can recommend the right storage and backup solutions to fit exactly what you need and want with products from Promise, LaCie, G-Tech and more. The industry is constantly changing and as a result it can be difficult to navigate which is why we’re always on the lookout to find the best solutions out there to match your specific needs.

		<title>A Note for our Existing Sony Anycast Owners...</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1098</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2012 15:11:08 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sony has recently announced that their <a href="http://www.rule.com/sales/product/default.aspx?main-cat=17&amp;id=2070">AWSG500E</a> Anycast Station Live Content Producer will be discontinued.  For many years the Anycast has been a "go to" portable video switcher, audio mixer, PTZ camera controller &amp; more in a self-contained, briefcase sized package.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Anycast.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099" title="Anycast" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Anycast.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="251" /></a>

Many of our customers over the years have used it and continue to rely on it for day-to-day use in events, public access, education, houses of worship, and a whole range of productions.  For most of our customers, once they have used the Anycast they continue to use and rely on it.

Normally, our instinct is to jump right into the latest and greatest technology, especially when we receive news of a discontinuation.  I am not saying that there are not alternative replacements on the market right now but I will say that the form factor and capability of the Sony Anycast are not easily matched.

If you have used and enjoyed the Sony Anycast and/or if you have established environments that already rely on the Anycast then it is not too late to purchase one.  Our sales team can still quote and sell you an Anycast including any optional boards needed.  Please reach out to them at <a href="mailto:rulesales@rule.com">rulesales@rule.com</a> for more info and to request a quote before it is too late!

Sony has a excellent track record for servicing and supporting products long after they have ceased to exist as a sales product.  Our Rental Department owns many of these systems and we are not planning on removing them from rotation anytime soon.

I hope this helps!

		<title>Observations from NAB 2012</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1125</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Each year that I attend NAB I usually end up having two or three words that sum up the most popular or most discussed trends at the show.

This year I would have to say Thunderbolt and 4K were the buzzword winners.  It was also interesting to see companies suddenly dive into market segments that used to be "reserved".  Blackmagic Design is suddenly a camera manufacturer and Canon is suddenly a production monitor company.  Go Pro offers WiFi and high speed goes handheld with the TS3Cine.

<img class="alignleft" title="Thunderbolt" src="http://newsroom.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2035-1450/tb_vrt_rgb_3000.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="57" />

was everywhere this year. The AJA Ki Pro QUAD, Blackmagic Design Cinema Camera, and of course drives of all sorts.  There was even a 30 meter optical Thunderbolt cable from Sumitomo.

<img class="alignleft" title="4K" src="http://www.blackmagic-design.com/media/23213/4kdigital.jpg" alt="" width="111" height="68" />The term "4K Capable" means that external 4K recorders can be attached to such cameras as the Canon EOS C500 and 1D C, Sony FS700, F65 and others.  Canon showed a prototype of a 4K production monitor that looked remarkable.

LED lighting is now ready for production use.

Notably absent this year - 3D!

Fujinon showed a lightweight 19mm-90mm PL cine zoom lens with a detachable servo drive unit

<img class="alignleft" title="Studio Daily Fujionon Lens" src="http://cdn.studiodaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/630_fujinon.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="248" />

Angenieux also showed a Servo unit compatible with thei lightweight Optimo line :
Optimo 45-120, Optimo 28-76,
Optimo 15-40 for Film and Digital cinema,
Optimo DP 16-42 and Optimo DP 30-80
for Digital Cinema.

		<title>What to do with the handle on the FS100 when it turns out that its not really a “handle”?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was shooting recently with the FS100UK with the kit 18-200 lens, a Litepanel mini plus, a Sennheiser wireless receiver, and a Shotgun microphone in a poorly lit '”run &amp; gun scenario". The stock "handle" was not up to the task of supporting all of these accessories and required quite a few black hair elastics just to keep things from bouncing around.

When I got back and reviewed the condition of our FS-100 handles in rentals, I said, 'There has to be some better way of handling this'. With locking screws stripped and parts on back order from Sony, a simple repair was not the best solution.

Enter Caleb Crosby of Shot Grip with his Wood &amp; Aluminum handles for the FS100. (<a href="http://shootingmachine.net/)">http://shootingmachine.net/)</a>

I immediately took a liking to the handles, and worked quickly to outfit our rental cameras with this accessory (featured in our showroom). Why worry about the plastic breaking again when we could replace it with something that provided a better end-user experience, more functionality, and more mounting options -- not to mention a pretty sweet look too! We took advantage of Shot Grip’s stub clamps to re-mount the stock microphone, and a few others stub clamps for lighting accessories and a wireless transmitter. The package was complete!

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fs100_handle.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1252" title="fs100_handle" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fs100_handle-300x266.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="266" /></a>

Caleb came by recently and we chatted about development of a new product he unveiled at NAB. Caleb will be getting us some more handles from craftsmen in a shop just north of us in Maine. I'm so grateful for such an easy and elegant solution to this problem.

		<title>Tripod FAQs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Manfrotto 701HDV, MVT502AM</strong> Tripod System with Carrying Bag is an LW tripod system kit for camcorders or DSLRs up to 8.8 lb. This System combines the 701HDV Pro Fluid Head with the new MVT502AM tripod.</p>
<p>This system is the smallest folding length of any Manfrotto to date.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>closed length: 29.53 in</li>
<li>maximum height: 61.42 in</li>
<li>minimum height: 27.76 in</li>
<li>load capacity: 8.82 lbs</li>
<li>weight: 8.38 lbs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The 504HD, 546BK</strong> has an aluminum crown head with a built-in 75mm bowl. The tripod's telescopic mid-level spreader holds the tripod together and its sturdy feet connect to the legs without any problem.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum Height: 65.94 in</li>
<li>Minimum Height: 17.32 in</li>
<li>Load Capacity: 19.84 lbs</li>
<li>Weight: 13.89 lbs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sachtler-Ace: </strong>Well, what’s different about the Sachtler Ace? It’s the only tripod with its own webpage (<a href="http://www.sactler-ace.com">www.sachtler-ace.com</a>) and includes a thrilling demo reel with the tagline “You only get one shot so make it count.”  Sachtler broke the $500 price mark range with a tripod that was ergonomical as well as affordable for the student, independent filmmaker, etc.</p>
<p>It includes a 5+0 counterbalance, 90-75 degree tilt range, 8.8 payload range.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weights: 10 lbs.</li>
<li>Height min: 22.4”</li>
<li>Height max: 68.1”</li>
<li>Transport Length: 34.3”</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I’m going to list the main comments, questions, and concerns that I get all the time from customers about tripods.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I need a light tripod.  I can’t carry a heavy one.</strong> Now, I am 5’2" and weigh under 100 lbs.  I get it.  But, the fact is that while you don’t want to break yourself, if your camera needs a heavier tripod, you’ve got to figure out a way to manage it. For example, you might get a tripod bag with wheels (Kata makes a great one) or bring another person along to carry it.  Do not fail in this area to get a tripod made for a 5D when you have a heavier camera or a lighter camera loaded up with accessories.</li>
<li><strong>What is the tripod that folds up the smallest? </strong>Most tripods do not fold up smaller than 34” long.  That’s the norm. Now, folding up length is different than standing minimum height.  But to answer the question, as far as I know, the one that folds up the smallest for travel is the Manfrotto 701, 502MVK at 29.9” long.  <strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the difference between the FSB4 and the Sachtler Ace? </strong>Two main differences. Made of different materials at different parts. Different heads.  The FSB4 Head is the FSB4, the Ace is the ACE head.  These are made of different materials.  The FSB Head is made of aluminum, whereas the ACE head is made of aluminum and the silver bar in the middle is well-machined plastic.  The arm is shorter on the ACE than the FSB4. Ace has 3 grades of drag, FSB4 has 5. This affects the “fluid” feeling.  FSB4 has leak-proof fluid damping and a 10-step counterbalance system. ACE works at<strong> </strong>-30 where FSB4 works at -40 degrees.  ACE weighs 8.7 lbs, FSB4 weighs 9.7.  Spreader on the FSB4 is sturdier than on the ACE.</li>
<li><strong>I want thick legs.  Can I get thick sturdier legs with my head? </strong>Rule of thumb, the thicker legs that you see on Sachtler Video 18 heads, etc. normally fit with 100mm ball heads, which are definitely more expensive than 75mm heads, ranging more in the 2K-10K and up range.  Some manufacturers like Manfrotto make the 546BK legs, which are slightly thicker, and are generally wider than Sachtler legs that go with 75mm bowl heads. But if you want the thick, heavy legs, you need to go up to 100mm bowl, because the legs must also balance with the head to really control pan/tilt correctly with your camera.  <strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Can I get a 75mm to 100mm bowl adapter? </strong>Yes.  Manfrotto, Sachtler, and Vinten all make 75 to 100mm bowl adapters. Except the way they are worded, only Kessler really has it right in their name for it because you are in fact going down in size, from 100mm to 75mm.  You cannot make the bowl bigger, from 75mm to 100mm because a 100mm adapter does not fit in a 75mm hole.  Plus, a 100mm head on 75mm legs wouldn’t make sense because it wouldn’t be supported or balanced.  These adapters range in $32 for Manfrotto to $154 for Sachtler. <strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Can I use a photo tripod with my camera to make my camera go sideways? </strong>If you want.  But don’t take your hand off it because it’s going down to the ground if your camera is over 6 lbs!</li>

		<title>Bags named Petrol</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1263</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A question I get a LOT working at Rule is, “How do you guys choose your bags?”  The answer is: carefully.  When a new line or an interesting item comes on the market, we either take it is as a demo, or we stock it and try it out.  If it’s good, we order more.  If it’s bad, we never order it again.

With bags, a lot of us here shoot.  We have our preferences.  We also rely a lot on our client’s referrals for what they use and are happy with.  I’m focusing this blog on Petrol because it’s not a new line of bags, but they’ve made several new developments feature-wise that I appreciate, that other companies have not yet adapted.

The first nice thing, is the inclusion of a line of LED lights on the inside of the bag.  Night shoots, especially in the fall go after 5PM a lot of the time.  Packing up is often done in the dark, even if shooting isn’t.  Being able to open up your bag and see where things go without holding a flashlight in the other hand is an immediate bonus.

The other is that Petrol makes really nice lighting bags.  They’re not cheap.  But if you’re looking for a bag that is SIMPLE, with wheels, and not overdone, Petrol makes a good one similar to the size of the Arri 3-piece light kit, except in soft-case, hard-foam form.   They also make a C-Stand bag, which comes in handy because, let's admit it, C-stands are usually tossed in the van or truck un-cased, and they are awkward to carry around while trying to carry other equipment.

An interesting addition to the Petrol line is the Cambio bag.  Prognosis is still out on this. Petrol is trying to be creative by putting a pull-out tripod on a bag, excluding the need for a tripod.  This is something that might seem dinky at first, but if you’re traveling up a mountain and now need a tripod and you’ve got one, this might seem like the best idea ever.  In everyday situations though, it's always better to plan out your shots AND your equipment.

A customer favorite is the Deca-Lightweight Audio Bag and the Deca Eargonizer.  These are well-designed sound recorder bags.  I pair everyone who is using more than just a sound recorder with one of these bags.  For example, if you are using a pair of wireless lavs with a sound recorder or mixer, this bag just makes sense. It’s organized with clear material in the right places and balanced with pockets for EVERYTHING so that you’re not fumbling around trying to separate wires and cords.

That is a quick summation! In another few weeks, we will be stocking the Petrol PC104, the PC302, the Decashell Cam Backpack and the PM805.  The Decashell Cam Backpack is of specific interest, as it looks like a normal day backpack, yet holds a lot of gear.  It is mostly black with only small labels, so it will not draw attention to the equipment if you are going overseas!  Also feel free to email <a href="mailto:rulesales@rule.com">rulesales@rule.com</a>, or any of our sales reps for more information.

		<title>Shooting with the Ringlite Mini: Siiiick!</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1268</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was about to shoot a music video for a friend who is in a local Boston rock band called <a href="http://nervous.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Nervous</a>. We threw ideas around for a while, but we ended up with a pretty simple concept of a girl bumming around her house and eventually going on a bike ride. Not very complex, but who cares, it's a music video! Our friend Marianne who would play the girl, had recently gotten into a bike accident. She had a busted up hand with a brace on it, and her eyeball had a few broken blood vessels in it. I felt these physical attributes would make the content weirder, and so I decided to accentuate them.

For the opening shot, which is a close up of Marianne's face, we used the <strong>Litepanels Ringlite Mini</strong> to make her eyes look even more bizarre. Specs of red in the white of her eye, and a ring of white in the pupil. It looked <em>mad cool</em>. I would even go as far as to say it looked <em>dope.</em>

[caption id="attachment_1271" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Grey Gardens"]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1271" title="Broken Blood Vessels" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></dt> </dl></div>
The original intent of using the Ringlite was to gain a certain effect for all of the interior apartment scenes. I wanted it to look a bit like “Grey Gardens” and a bit like Fiona Apple's video for “Criminal”. Both of these pieces use some type of camera mounted light. “Grey Gardens” being a doc with many dimly lit interiors, does it for necessity.
<div class="mceTemp"><dl id="attachment_1277" class="wp-caption " style="width: 310px;"> <dt>
<div class="mceTemp"><dl id="attachment_1277" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Picture-2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1277" title="Grey Gardens" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Picture-2-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a>[/caption]

</dt> </dl></div>
“Criminal”employs a drastic spotlight effect in interior spaces as a stylistic choice.

[caption id="attachment_1270" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Criminal Music Video."]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Criminal-Music-Video.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1270" title="Criminal Music Video" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Criminal-Music-Video-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>[/caption]

I wanted to meet in the middle between these two looks. I had the Ringlite mounted for every interior shot. Obviously it didn't end up being the prettiest footage in the world, but that wasn't the point of doing it. It gave the desired effect. As the camera moves in the wide shots, you can see the light fall off around all edges of the frame. As Marianne moves through the frame, her body  gets darker and lighter depending on her distance from the camera. Her skin even blows out a bit in the times where she briefly gets very close to the camera. I made her do many tasks around the house like wash dishes,make coffee, play video games, answer the phone, and change sweaters a number of times. All things that are somewhat dexterous, and that would accentuate the inconvenience of the hand brace. All of my close ups I did almost too close. When I would have normally used a 65 or an 85, instead I used a 135. I was changing lenses frequently, but the Ringlite wasn't much of a hassle. It slides on and off with the greatest of ease.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1274" title="MyStuff.4" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.4-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1272" title="MyStuff.2" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1275" title="MyStuff.5" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.5-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1273" title="MyStuff.3" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MyStuff.3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />

I had a pretty minimal setup with a Sony F3, set of Zeiss Superspeeds and the Ringlite. I had a couple other lights that I used sparingly. So I used the Ringlite for two totally different purposes and they both worked out splendidly. It's easy to mount, very lightweight, and has a ton of adjustability and light level control. It's siiiiiick.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Manfrotto recently released the Sympla rig, which they call the “system moving platform.”  The name is quite fitting considering how many different variations of this rig are available.  Let's go over the separate pieces, which include:

<strong>HDSLR Clamp-On Remote Control: </strong>There are two versions of this -- one with iris, shutter, ISO and focus point control, and the other with just focus point control.  The first one mentioned attaches with a Manfrotto rosette to the side of a Manfrotto Tripod and acts as a 2<sup>nd</sup> arm to the tripod, putting together a studio setup environment for the camera.

<strong>Sympla Variable Plate:</strong> This is a fancy name for a Manfrotto baseplate which is actually similar to any Manfrotto quick release on the market that uses a 501 tipod plate.  It will fit most Manfrotto video and photo tripod heads, making the mount interchangeable.

<strong>Sympla Shoulder Pad:</strong> This actually is not padded, but many people think it is very comfortable despite that fact.  It leans on the shoulder and allows a weight to hook on the back with a 3/8" screw.

<strong>Sympla Adjustable Handles:</strong> These are not 15mm rod mounted. They are handles custom to the Sympla rig, so you won't be able to move or interchange them with handles on any of your other rigs.  They go straight down and the angle is adjustable at the very top of the handle.

<strong>Sympla Flexible Mattebox:</strong> This mattebox is perhaps the coolest of it's kind and the coolest on the market!  It is called a universal mattebox, but it is universal in more ways than one. It has 4 “lengths” -- lengths equaling from the camera on out.  This mattebox is made of a thick flexible rubber, which holds shape when you bend it and adjusts to the way the light falls without changing your entire setup.  The mattebox pushes in to become smaller or pulls out to become longer.  It does include step down rigs and what is called Nuns Knickers, or a Shade to go between the camera and the step down ring to ensure that no light gets in.

<strong>Fig Rig:</strong> The Fig Rig is a steering wheel that goes around the camera.  The lens sits through the steering wheel to balance the weight, and the shoulder pad is turned upside down to lean against you instead of going over you.

<strong>Lens Support: </strong>Lens support is a sloped piece that sits under the lens to support it.  This is actually a nice way of doing it, as you don’t have to screw anything in.

That being said, it’s a nice way to focus your DSLR while it's attached to a rig, or think of it as another way of putting a tripod in a studio-like setup.  The focus is accurate and not painfully slow.   I would recommend this if you’re looking to operate a little differently than what you are used to with more flexibility -- especially when you are shoulder mounted.

		<title>Canon Cinema with SNL’s Alex Buono</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Those who braved the spontaneous monsoon and made their way to the Yawkey Theater at WGBH in Boston on Wednesday, August 1st, were treated to an inspiring, funny and informative discussion with Alex Buono, the Director of Photography for Saturday Night Live’s Film Unit. The event was sponsored by FRONTLINE, Rule Boston Camera and Canon, and guests were wined and dined and encouraged to see, touch and shoot with the new C300 camera, which has been unbelievably popular since its release earlier this year. Buono uses the C300 in addition to several other Canon cameras for his work, including the 5D Mark II, 7D and the XF305. He shared some of his experiences on set and delved into how and why Canon’s cameras allow him to accomplish things he never could before in less time than ever, plus dropped tips and tricks throughout his presentation for people looking to get into DSLR or cine-style shooting. Naturally, I can’t cover everything here, but I’ll highlight some of the most interesting tidbits.
<div class="mceTemp"><dl id="attachment_1298" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgn4OKI71qjgy1m.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1298" title="Presented by Alex Buono" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgn4OKI71qjgy1m-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></dt> </dl></div>
Buono started shooting for the SNL Film Unit back in 1999, when they were still shooting on film. That was a challenge, he said, because their typical shooting schedule goes like this: the writers deliver the script on Wednesday, they prep on Thursday, shoot on Friday and edit and air the final product on Saturday. Those turnaround times were brutal with film, but with new tapeless workflows, especially with the MXF MPEG-2 format the C300 shoots, they don’t have to bog themselves down with film processing or telecine, or even the painful rendering times that other video workflows might require.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgouE4w61qjgy1m.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1299" title="tumblr_m8cgouE4w61qjgy1m" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgouE4w61qjgy1m-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>

Canon’s cameras made it onto Saturday Night Live’s broadcasts in 2009, when Buono used the then-new 5D Mark II to shoot the opening sequence for the show. It was a bold step and a big undertaking, but he was impressed by the unprecedented light sensitivity, the ability to shoot in tiny spaces with a much smaller crew, and of course, the picture quality and shallow depth of field that he had struggled to achieve since leaving his film cameras on the shelf years before. After the success of that shoot, they adopted DSLRs into their workflow and have now added the C300 to their arsenal, which is Buono’s favorite tool yet.

I was excited to see how Buono uses these cameras in his work every week and some of the additional equipment he has been particularly fond of. He spoke highly of a number of third-party accessories, including the “Target Shooter” and “The Event,” which are two different shoulder rigs from Zacuto and Red Rock Micro, respectively. He also never leaves home without his Zacuto Z-Finder Pro. Buono also showed off some seriously useful smartphone apps he relies on for location shooting, like Sunseeker and Helios for tracking movement of the sun. Most impressively, he showed us how to do “virtual location scouting” with Google Earth. Using their 3D building models and the time of day feature, he could track the movement of the sun throughout the day, plan out all of his framing, plus get contact information for buildings he wanted access to—all within the Google Earth application.

Buono spent a good portion of his presentation talking about the technical specifications of the C300, but emphasized an important point (and my favorite tip from the evening): <strong>filmmaking is not a science project</strong>. In an industry where it’s easy to get caught up in numbers, feature lists and marketing jargon, it’s important to remember that these cameras are filmmaking tools that help us achieve our visions as storytellers. And the introduction of more affordable equipment and the resulting leveling of the playing field has allowed people to focus less on how much money and effort it takes to get a good picture and more on the things that really matter—good writing and good performances. That being said, he went into a detailed discussion about how the C300 captures and records color information, how capturing two green channels on the sensor dramatically improves low-light capability and how the form factor has significantly improved their flexibility while shooting, both with shoulder/handheld setups and in Steadicam applications. He also emphasized how great it is to be able to shoot a scene with Andy Samberg in the middle of Times Square without swarms of tourists taking any notice at all. Shooting incognito is a luxury few crews with SNL’s level of exposure enjoy.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgpqaAXA1qjgy1m.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1301" title="tumblr_m8cgpqaAXA1qjgy1m" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr_m8cgpqaAXA1qjgy1m-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>

I was also pleased to hear him talk about the importance of color grading with tools like Apple Color, Final Cut Pro, Tiffen DFX or Magic Bullet. He also emphasized how critical good sound is, and recommended that everybody use a decent microphone (like the Rode Stereo VideoMic Pro) and record to something other than a DSLR—be it in-camera on the C300 or with external recorder (like the Zoom H4N). Shooting at 24 frames per second instead of 30 or 60 and using a 180-degree shutter (1/50<sup>th</sup> of a second on a DSLR) was also his recommendation as the single most important (and probably easiest) step for achieving a cinematic look with your video.

There was plenty more that Alex Buono had to say about his experiences shooting commercial parodies, skits and other videos for SNL, as well as his impressions of the new Canon C300, but there was simply too much great information to cover here. He’s been traveling all around the country giving these kinds of presentations, so if you’re lucky, he may be making his way to a city near you and you can hear more about what he has to say. You can also follow him on Twitter at @alexbuono or go to alexbuonoreel.com to see more of his work.

		<title>Sachtler ACE/FSB4 Quick Comparison</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1326</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people question the wisdom of buying an ACE over a Sachtler FSB4, so I thought I would hopefully put some of those questions to rest.

The Sachtler line is well known for their FSB4 and FSB6 tripods, which are the go-to tripods for smaller and standard camcorders.  These tripods fit cameras anywhere from the Canon XF-105 to the PMW EX3.

FSB4 holds 8.8 lbs, weighs 10.7 lbs, and also has 5 steps of counter balance and 3 grades of drag but also contains a spring loaded counter balance, which the ACE has, but as far as the actual "fluid drag system" the ACE has its own patented name for its fluid drag, which does not allow for a technical comparison between it and the Sachtler FSB4, because there are no numbers to compare or info on how the heads are made exactly, that is Sachtler patented information.

The Ace, which was introduced last year, also holds 8.8 lbs, weighs 9.7 lbs., and its price point of $535 makes getting a professional tripod more do-able for those on a budget.  It features 5 steps of counter balance and 3 grades of drag.

The biggest difference between the two? The ACE's head is made of plastic (glass fiber composite) , while the Sachtler FSB4 is aluminum.  They are similar in weight, hold capacity, height, and style.  You'll feel the drag function more smoothly in the FSB4 than the ACE.

The latest update is that the ACE now is being offered with carbon fiber legs, in telescopic proportions.  That mean 10.2" min height, no spreader, and only 5.1 lbs. for the legs.  These legs will also be available for tripods such as the FSB 4.  The Carbon Fiber version will run somewhere around the price of the aluminum Sachtler, which is $899.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Azden brand goes along with Rode and Sennheiser, but they seem to have filled a gap that has been left open for awhile by the mainstream brands.  Juiced Link and Beachtek have both produced small sound mixers, that leave some to be desired, but Azden has housed their own in a more sophisticated, small box that operates in the same fashion, but gives the user more control over their levels, as well as includes a jack for headphones in addition to the dual XLR inputs, and the L and R channel level controls.

Azden also covers a FMX 42/42a 4-channel portable mixer, which offers 4 XLR inputs and 2 XLR outputs plus a mini plug output, adjustable input level monitor level, and adds a 10-pin  and mini plug camera return.

These sound mixers run from $400 for the smaller dual channel mixer to $840 for the larger 4 channel mixers.

Another unique product is the Azden dual receiver/transmitter kit. Running at $750, this price is highly competitive with buying two Azden or Sennheiser kits at around $599 each.  This dual receiver allows you to mic two people and run separate channels into one receiver, rather than using two receivers and two transmitters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Very interesting  "first look" at the new Sony cameras. Sony's Juan Martinez presented working cameras and the technology supporting them.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Twarog+Martinez.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1340" title="Twarog+Martinez" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Twarog+Martinez-300x223.jpg" alt="The New Sony F55" width="300" height="223" /></a>

They seem very good, very modular and flexible. Quite ergonomically designed regardless of the "boxy" appearance. We ended up with samples of recording, but we do not have a new software, which understands new codec - XAVC, yet, but VLC Player could play them back! Confirming promised resolution. New Content Browser from Sony sees it, too. But it cannot play it back, yet.  More to come!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The very well-received introduction to the new Sony cameras took place at Rule with a double header Learning Lab (a.m.) and Pub Night (p.m.). We had a good-sized crowd who applauded the new cameras modular build, ergonomics of design and "plug &amp; play" functionality (camera recognizes any connected component and takes control over it).

The cameras should be available in 2-3 weeks from now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had an opportunity to see one of the new Panasonic products - the recently-released PT-DZ470 projector. Jan Crittenden Livingston brought it to Rule before this Wednesday's 5/8/13 Learning Lab, which was a recap of Panasonic's featured products at this year's NAB conference.

The projector is very bright (3500 lumen) and shows material very quickly (no warm up time). It is not at all hot, has a very handy manual lens shift (joystick like), and it can be mounted horizontally or vertically.  One of it's main features is the fact that it does not use a lamp.  As a result, it has a very long and trouble-free user time which is estimated to be 20,000 hours. It looks like there is no maintenance, and, with its very good, quality picture, it seems to be a really exceptional product -- especially if its promised longevity is true!

		<title>The Flexibility of Kata Camera Bags</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1368</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Staying true to the Gemini ways, I have a hard time making decisions.  Just ask my husband when it’s time to pick a restaurant for dinner.   And when I do finally make a decision, I often change my mind immediately afterwards, otherwise, the dreaded indecision kicks in.  What does this have to do with camera bags, you ask?  Well I’ll tell you.

I’d been searching for a bag that would fit my equipment needs.  My current bag is very limited on how it can be arranged or organized, and it doesn’t hold as much as I’d like it to, which is a problem for my ever-growing equipment inventory.  I have to dump and reorganize it constantly to accommodate whatever project or gig I’m doing, sometimes leaving equipment home that I’d like to bring.

[caption id="attachment_1374" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="The Bumblebee 220 PL"]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bumblebee-220pl.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1374" title="Bumblebee 220 PL" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bumblebee-220pl-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a>[/caption]

For the slightly compulsive organizer like me, the flexibility that Kata bags offer is a perfect fit.  They are very modular and customizable with interchangeable inserts, letting you arrange and rearrange to your heart’s content.  They are able to fit a wide range of camera bodies, lenses, and other accessories in a very compact and lightweight package, all while thoroughly protecting your gear and keeping it easily accessible while you’re on the go.  Some bags even have pockets for a laptop, and others have a place to attach a tripod.

Kata bags are also easy to carry, whether you go with a backpack, sling, or rolling bag style.  When I’m on a shoot or traveling, I don’t like to be weighed down.  I’m a small person, so it doesn’t take much for equipment to get heavy.  I usually over-pack for everything (part of being indecisive… hey, I might need that lens I never shoot with!), so being able to take most or all of my gear easily is a great feature.  Perfect, indecision cured!  At least for the moment anyway.

Overall, Kata is the solution you’re looking for if you need to carry a good amount of gear in as small of a package as possible.  They are lightweight but durable and protective.  Some of the products available include DSLR and camcorder bags, rain covers, and bags for tripods, lights, and more.  Kata is definitely a bag that can grow with you for a long time as your equipment upgrades and changes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We upgraded our GoPro Hero3 cameras to new firmware v.3.0 recently. I tested the cameras with new iOS GoPro application (v.2.0). It offers live preview now (while recording), which works quite well. The control of camera settings also works very well. The availability of  web browsing is only available when switched to Internet access mode (not controlling the camera).

New features do not always work, as promised, yet! Playback from camera, on iPad 3 works sporadically, sometimes stalling on “Loading images” screen. But when it works, it is spectacular! It makes the file transfer from card to iPad and further distributing it, very easy.

[caption id="attachment_1383" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="GoPro HERO3"]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/95803_i_1.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1383" title="GoPro HERO3" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/95803_i_1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]

These are the new application features:

-View photos and play back videos
-Copy photos and videos to a GoPro album on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch
-Share the photos and videos copied to your device via email, text, Instagram™, Facebook® or other apps
-Browse and delete files on the camera's memory card

		<title>And then the camera moves left…</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1395</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How often when storyboarding your next project, do you plot in a camera move? I mean a major one, not just a tilt up or pan left. I know that in my own projects, it’s been a long time since I planned for a large move. Without an entire G&amp;E department to support my projects or the budget for a Steadicam operator, I just want to keep everything as easy for myself as possible.  But I also know that by skipping this, I’m wasting a big part of the beauty of motion pictures.

Now that I’m interning at Rule, I’ve had the chance to see a few options for camera moves that might be within reach for my own projects. In less than a month, I’ve seen jibs and a Steadicam rig, as well as two options that I think could really work for my next project… the Easy Jib by Grip Control and a Doorway Dolly.

The first, the Easy Jib (as you may know if you’ve ever seen it before) is basically a large slider. This is the perfect tool for getting roughly a five foot move into your project. It’s long, but not very heavy, and doesn’t have a ton of add-ons, so you can easily get it into a third floor walk-up. You can put it on a table or a counter or on two stands or even on the floor for a nice low angle. It’s also easy to operate with only one person. Just a gentle hand to guide the glider and the other can pan or rack focus.

The only real cons are the limited size and the fact that you really need an external monitor. It’s not easy to follow an eyepiece with this dolly.

The other dolly, the Doorway Dolly, is another great option, albeit a much bigger, less easily transported one. But there’s no need to wrangle a bunch of track with this dolly. It has four reasonably quiet rubber tires and can hold a standard size tripod. As you can guess, though, you need at least two people to pull off any camera moves with this dolly. One person to drive and one person along for the ride to operate the camera.

Additionally, I found that the steering, while relatively easy, is not an exact science. Without tracks to guarantee an exact mark, you could end up just to left or right of where you wanted to be. This could make for a focusing nightmare if you’re working in low-light, wide-open aperture situations.

Overall, I like both of these options. Both get the camera moving around the room without a cumbersome track system and without much added to your gear list. They might seem slightly unromantic compared to other options that are out there, but sometimes all you need is a little utility to get the job done well! Happy filming!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When working on a films, I’ve noticed that sound is typically the thing I’m least worried about. This isn’t because it is an easy, insignificant part of filmmaking, because it’s the exact opposite. Sound is a very important part of a film, and does just as hard of a job of telling a story and evoking feeling as story, acting, and cinematography. That is why I’ve come to acclimate myself with the various equipment used for recording sound.

The first, and most important instrument in sound production is the Sound Device 702 recorder. This piece of equipment has two sound channels, XLR and BNC outputs, records to compact flash cards, and has easily navigable menus. On top of all this, it is made of a sturdy (albeit heavy) material that will prevent simple destruction or damages.

The 702 recorder works well with the Sound Devices 302 mixer. Along with the recorder, the mixer is an extremely compact, portable, and ergonomic device. Its three channels are easily monitored and adjusted, requiring little time to learn.

As for devices for gathering sound, I have found that there are numerous options. Obviously there is the array of dynamic and condenser microphones (cardioids, hyper-cardioids, omni-directional microphones, and so on). The latter are the typical “shotgun” microphones that are mounted on top of cameras, or found at the end of boom poles. They are the go-to microphones for filmmaking.

For scenarios in which condenser microphones aren’t practical – such as for wide shots when boom poles risk being seen and camera microphones are too far for authentic sound – then there is a wireless alternative: lavalier microphones.

Rather than looking for a ficus to hide a condenser microphone in, a lavalier microphone is wireless, and can be mounted and hidden on the actors and acquire usable sound. When I say usable sound, I mean sound that doesn’t quite come to par with condensers, but considering the situation, they get the job done. Many times filmmakers will gawk at the idea of using lavalier microphones because of a lav’s potentially inferior quality (especially when you have cats in the scene – they’ll play with the little bobbing microphone like a ball of yarn). However, the day will come when your boom pole will catch fire, and all you’ll have left are these bad boys.

On the subject of wireless sound devices, there is an astoundingly useful tool for filmmakers to use behind the camera: the HME 800 or HME PRO 850. These are kits with 5 headsets with built-in microphones that are used like walkie-talkies (however, with many more batteries required). This intercom kit is so practical that its uses are near limitless. On set crew can communicate swiftly without running around; assistant directors can let a set know what the afternoon schedule looks like; and in a case where a shot requires multiple cameras with operators, a director of photography can give each one of them commands without any issues.

The HME 800, and the HME PRO 850, are both quite intuitive devices and require very little time to learn and grow accustomed with. Even though they aren’t used for the creative part of filmmaking, “in front of the camera,” they are priceless assets for effective and efficient management on a set.

This amalgamation of sound devices each has their own strengths and weaknesses. The benefit with having each of these items on your film set provides you with options, and options create flexibility, and flexibility leads to efficiency.

		<title>Falloff Rates and Dimmer Accuracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Built-in Dimmers are oh-so-convenient. If a cloud screws up the relation of an artificial fill or you just want less heat on the side of her face, bliss is just a twist away.

But how useful are these built-in dimmers in creating dramatic changes in exposure? Are the dimmers really calibrated to be useful to a precise cinematographer? I tested three popular lights to compare which lights had the most useful dimmer system: the <strong>1x1 Lightpanel </strong>(LED), the <strong>Kinoflo Diva</strong> (daylight fluorescent), and the <strong>Bron Kobold 400 Watt All-Weather System</strong> (HMI).

The criterion for a “useful dimmer” included a <strong>consistent fall-off rate in exposure</strong> (f-stop) as the light is dimmed (proportionally) and <strong>accurate visual measurement markings around the knob </strong>corresponding to the change in brightness measured. If I’ve turned the knob halfway but the light hasn’t cut down at all, I’m not happy.
<div>And just so that this blog post isn’t too technical or stuffy, we won’t do any math or go over the scientific proceedings. Just know it involved me, a light meter, some blocking tape, and a garage with no outside light. And we’ll refer to my crudely drawn and scanned-in graph (below) to draw some lofty conclusions.</div>
<img src="webkit-fake-url://4706B452-2890-49DF-8A2A-A7BA531D3952/application.pdf" alt="" />

If you glance briefly at the graphs (but don’t scrutinize them too much) you’ll see the LED easily wins for best dimmer system. Its results form the closest semblance of a linear graph. Even more surprisingly, I found that the incremental knob markings accurately cut the light between a ½ or full stop all the way to the 25 mark.

Second place goes to the Kinoflo Diva. It got off to a rocky start, but eventually started dimming noticeably. However, I quickly realized that the dimmer markings were more of a nice yellow design and not meant to be accurate in the least. The arbitrariness of the Kinoflo Diva, regardless of marked change near the end, make it useful for quick, sizable adjustments, but it is not nearly as precise and nuanced as the LED. Furthermore, it can turn from 4 bulbs to 2 bulbs, which probably mirrors its dimmer in its restrictedness. So what’s the point of the dimmer?

The HMI finished last—and who could blame him? HMIs already rock and have nothing to prove (this one is even waterproof) but if it’s not going to dim in any noticeable way, don’t waste our time with a dimmer system.

Perhaps this is due to a poorly executed experiment (I’m a film major, take it easy), or maybe the HMI takes longer to warm up to its dimmer settings. But those last minute touches can’t freeze a shoot for five minutes as the HMI gets its act together. Clearly, then, the HMI has arbitrary markings on its ballast and isn’t too concerned with dimming itself. But it is still the brightest. We’ll give it a point for that.

Here’s the data if you really really really like dimming/mood lighting/being picky about exposure/like turning knobs.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KINOFLO Diva (fluorescent)</span></strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1x1 Lightpanel (LED) </span></strong>

<strong> </strong>

100%= f/8

90%= f/ 5.6-8 split

80%= ¼ under f/5.6

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the influx of Canon C100 Ownership, the topic of handheld systems oftentimes comes up.  Clients are either used to shooting with an ENG style shoulder mount camera or DSLR’s and want to transfer the handheld shooting skills with either to a camera like the C100. Now the C100 is a great camera, but ergonomically normal a camera it is not.  Luckily, companies like Zacuto bring along great products to help make that transition much simpler and more cost-effective.

The most recent rig to cross my path was the Zacuto Recoil V2, a product I had seen and specced for awhile but never got hands on with.  Set-up with the Recoil goes quickly and is pretty intuitive.  Where this rig gets it right is the grip relocator, which is worth the price of admission all on it’s own.  This may be the most cost-effective single piece to be used with rods that retains the same functionality of the camera on the market.  No longer are you using a dumb handle for the sake of handheld; you’ll get all the functionality of the hand grip just in a more logical place. You simply connect the 1/8” plug from your grip into the receiver and then run the 20”+ cable back up to the port on the camera and voila. Now for some bad. Well sort of bad.

On Zacuto’s product page, they specifically address needing an EVF for this rig. Sad to say, there really isn’t a way around this…for a C100.  For a C300, however, the ability to articulate and move the EVF that comes with the camera makes a lot more sense and works well for this rig.  The same rule would apply with a C500. For the C100 ultimately, using an EVF with an articulating arm serves the trick as you can now create a more flexible and positional eyepiece.

Secondly, I would recommend some longer rods to allow for more flexible adjustment of distance for the camera.  Ideally you want the weight to be on your shoulder for the best hand held support, and longer rods allow you to move the grip locator to a more comfortable position. The shoulder pad QRP system is handy as well and is pretty flexible in terms of placement.  It’s easily positioned and removable.

One huge note to make with this rig: Be sure to use the Tripod TB-1 Adapter Plate that comes with the camera to work with the rig.  The only two points of contact on the rig are 3/8” and ¼ 20”; no safety pin.  So be sure that’s on the bottom before you start rigging. Another suggestion is the use of a Quick Release Plate System to create a fluid workflow from tripod work to shoulder supported, handheld work. I found the Kessler Kwik Release plate to pair well with the Zacuto set up.

All in all, this is a great, cost-effective rig to get you started with some handheld work, with some limitations.  No one rig will solve every problem, but I see the Recoil V2 as being a really smart and sharp start to solving some workflow hurdles with Canon’s Cinema EOS Camera line.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The buzz of excitement around the MoVI M10 by Freefly Systems is something for the record books. Every website is featuring articles on the M10, and test footage is being posted daily. I haven’t seen anything like it since the RED One was launched at NAB back in 2007. This three-axis brushless gimbal system really is a game changer in my opinion. After working with the unit for some time, I have gotten over the “hype” and started to realize the practicality of the unit and how it may start to change the way we think of putting a project together.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InStand1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1438" title="InStand" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InStand1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
Dolly Track, Operators, Jibs, Cranes, and much more won’t be a thing of the past, but, if one is working on a budget, there is a solution now that will help to cut down on all of these costs.  Sure, it may cost a nice chunk of change to buy, but <a href="http://www.rule.com/rentals/product/?main-cat=22&amp;id=4259" target="_blank"><strong><em>renting</em> the M10 is a great option</strong></a>. Less bodies and gear on set has never been a bad thing. One MoVI Operator, One Focus Puller, One Remote Control Operator and a Director sounds like a great production day. It’s that simple, and you can create a look that would take days of pre-production and hours of assembly on set to achieve. When you go to playback that first shot, trust me, you will be blown away at what you just captured in such a minimal manner.

After seeing what was possible with the M10, it was time to push it to the limits. Why not run with it at full speed and see what happens? Well, what happened was a shot that was so unbelievably smooth, I had to watch it three times! The footage was so much better than I expected. Then we received the Ninja Star Adapter.  At that point, I hadn’t heard much about what this would open up in terms of shooting with the MoVI. Boom!!! I grabbed the Porta-Jib and attached the MoVI to the Jib in an under-slung fashion, and it was time to rock. The results were hands-down the most responsive Remote Head I have ever worked with. Oh, and just to remind you all...it was Smoooooth!!

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/In-Hand.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1435" title="In Hand" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/In-Hand-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

The ten-pound load capacity that the M10 offers may scare one away at first. Fear not, you can achieve a very high level of production while using the unit for your project. Are you looking to work with the RED Epic? Consider it a done deal and with accessories. Let's use a Wireless Follow Focus System with that Zeiss Superspeed, and, of course, you want to transmit to a Wireless Monitor as well. All of these high-level production needs are possible with just a bit of tinkering and patience.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/movijib.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1437" title="movijib" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/movijib-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Oh, you say that you work with the Canon 5D MIII, Black Magic Cinema Camera, FS700, Canon C300, or C100? Not a problem in the least bit. All of these cameras will pair just perfectly with the MoVI M10, and the footage will be oh so smooooth!!!!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[That moment when the olive green Cinema Oxide case was placed by my desk will never be forgotten. What could be in there? Will this be life changing? What does all this mean? Long story short, by opening that case my life has changed drastically. I find myself thinking as a parent does for their child. However, my child’s name is a bit out of the norm. MoVI M10 has a nice ring, don’t you think?

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MoVI-In-Case2.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1447 alignright" title="MoVI In Case" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MoVI-In-Case2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Like any relationship, there are highs and lows. The M10 and I have shared all of these moments from the early headaches at the shop to the winter sunset walks along the Charles River. As our relationship has grown over the past few months, I have learned to appreciate MoVI for what it can do for the entire production community. It is a true game-changer that provides new opportunities and ease.

I have mentioned how easy the unit is to use, but I want you to take that with a grain of salt. There is a lot of time and effort that one needs to invest in order to initially understand how the M10 works and functions. It’s not as simple as taking it out of the box and starting to shoot right away. There are a few steps to remember in order to get optimal operation from the M10.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.21.14.MoVI-On-Stand-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1451" title="2.21.14.MoVI On Stand" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.21.14.MoVI-On-Stand-2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Before any balancing starts to happen, you always want to make sure that your camera is completely built up. Have your lens, follow focus, transmitter, cables, etc., all squared away. Even the weight of the lens cap will make a difference. Once the M10 is powered on, you want to refrain from adding or subtracting any weight. Adding and subtracting weight will throw the balance off, thus resulting in the motors working harder than necessary.

Once the camera is set, it's time to start the balancing procedures. Pan, Tilt, and Roll will be your favorite three words after spending some time with the M10. These are the three axes that the M10 works upon. Your balancing will be done in conjunction with these motors and functions.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.20.14.MoVI-M10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1448" title="2.20.14.MoVI M10" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.20.14.MoVI-M10-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

At this point your camera is attached to the sled, and you are making fine adjustments to get your perfect balance. When you first start balancing the M10, you'll want to channel all of your patience and take deep breaths. Sometimes the littlest adjustments will make all of the difference in a negative or positive way. Once you have spent enough time with the balancing process, it will start to become natural. Soon enough, you will have no problem swapping from a built-up Epic to a Blackmagic Pocket Camera.

Well, what are you waiting for? Now is the time to experience the M10 and introduce it as part of your next production. Just remember to take the time and learn the ways of the MoVI before you get on set. This extra prep time will save you from a headache and a frustrated Director. Now Is The Time for The MoVI M10!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me ask a silly but timely question:  Pretend you were a race car driver in NASCAR. You were in the middle of a race, flying around the track at 190 MPH, and a message popped up on your dashboard that told you that new firmware for your fuel system was available and ready to install, would you click OK?
<div>Historically, meaning as little as a few years ago, editing and post production suites were built and deployed as a completely designed system not unlike a race car.  Under it's branded and packaged "system" exterior, it was made up of components that, when described individually, were familiar to us.  It had one or many CPUs, operating system, memory, storage and I/O and several specific software applications, waveform/vector scopes and video source/record decks.  In addition, you would certainly have accurate monitoring of audio and video signals, ideally, in an acoustically-treated suite with appropriate lighting and wall color that would not confuse or deceive your visual cortex.</div>
This turnkey package was very tight, in large part because the bits and pieces worked only in a small but specific "compatibility matrix".  As a result, it was always understood and firmly communicated that you NEVER update software in the middle of a production, you disable Auto-Update (to satisfy the previous requirement) and that you work with and depend upon capable experts before and during planned upgrades.

Upgrades, in truth, need to be considered full re-designs in the sense that there is a delicate inter-dependency between all components and interrupting this "matrix" will have a series of consequences, and unless your name is Neo, you may not even realize that the matrix exists! (Sorry, had to throw that in there.)

Consequences come in many sizes and shapes.  Some, you may never even notice or feel and some may only effect you if a second or third seemingly unrelated event interacts with the dormant first consequence.  If the majority of customers work only on a stand-alone computer with the most common of add-on devices, then the lowest common denominator challenges or conflicts get addressed and corrected early, often during beta test cycles.

Companies like Apple and others have also done a great job intentionally or unintentionally inducing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Pavlovian Conditioning</a> with frequent and ever-improving app updates that have taught us that Updates = Good.  Many of us treat these update requests like a new message from a friend, a gift or a present that randomly appears and, best of all, is free!  Why wouldn't you do it?  Often it corrects and patches flaws and security risks that we didn't even know existed (until the update told us).  After all, who doesn't want to keep up with the latest and greatest?

But beware, the editing and graphics ecosystem that you have built, however streamlined it appears, is more fragile and requires more planning than a typical computer or smart phone.  Major operating system updates - like Apple Mavericks 10.9 - change a multitude of things, for reasons that have nothing to do with you or your business.

Here is an example advisory for some high speed, external media readers that came out upon the release of Apple Mavericks:

<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><em>"<strong>WARNING </strong>Qio E3 is not currently compatible with OS X 10.8.5 and 10.9 (Mavericks). Sonnet is working on a fix for this issue. Qio E3 is compatible with OS X 10.8.0 through 10.8.4 when using Qio E3 software v1.2.1c and later. Until a new driver is ready (1.2.2), do not upgrade your computer's OS to 10.8.5 or 10.9."</em></span>

Personally, I do not blame 3rd party board and hardware manufacturers for this.  A computer is a complex beast, designed for many markets and many uses.  In our high performance, time sensitive, video production world, we depend on our computers to connect with dozens of speciality devices.  Somehow, we have collectively come to expect that all parties involved have been handed a rule book that defines accurately and immediately, all use cases and all code corrections.  In truth, companies like Apple are famous for not providing detailed information about code or methodology changes that may break or change the way pieces or components behave.  There is limited access for developers to beta OS releases and it is next to impossible for a hardware company to run structured quality control tests on all possible configurations.

So, in summary, I offer a few polite words of caution:

• DO NOT be tempted to hit that Upgrade, Update or Download button without first KNOWING why you need it and what it might affect.

• PLAN for upgrades with production and business calendars in mind.
<div>• SCHEDULE downtime and testing as part of the upgrade.</div>
• BACKUP the current system before an upgrade.
<div>• TEST all of the devices and software after the upgrade.</div>
Thanks for listening.  I hope it helps.

		<title>Live Keying with the Sony AWS-750 Anycast Touch</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the new Sony Anycast Touch live switcher showed up here at Rule, no one really knew what to make of it. The knee-jerk reaction to the dual touch screen, Star Trek looking switcher, was a wave of mild curiosity - followed closely by the inevitable “Where are all the buttons!?” See, in the world of live events, switchers usually have switches -- physical buttons, knobs, and other touchy-feely things to give the user some satisfying real-world feedback when using the equipment. The new Anycast Touch, as one could assume from its namesake, looks more like an iPad than a switcher - and after you accept the new form factor, it’s awesome.

In this post, I won’t be going into every nut and bolt on the Anycast Touch. Instead, I’ll be focusing on one advanced ability -- <strong>live keying</strong>. If you’d like to know more about the overall basic operation, my tips and tricks, and a more in-depth outline of advanced workflows, RSVP to events@rule.com for my Learning Lab here at Rule on March 26th. We’ll be going over a handful of real-world switching situations to acclimate both seasoned vets and users who are new to live event production.

In the past, doing live chroma key work has always been a daunting task. Lighting your green or blue screen evenly was absolutely essential to getting a good, passable key - and to a large extent, this is still true today. The Anycast Touch is very forgiving, though. It deals with hot spots and wrinkles fairly well, though spill is something one should always be mindful of. A good rule of thumb is to simply get your talent as far away from that colored backdrop as possible for your framing.

The Sony Anycast Touch is unlike any other switcher when it comes to live keys (or anything else, really). The interface for keying will look familiar to any users who have used chroma keying features in any popular NLE. While it isn’t as populated with intricate refining features like Adobe’s UltraKey or Keylight, it’s surprisingly powerful.

<strong><em><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/anycastsub_01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1486" title="anycastsub_01" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/anycastsub_01-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>
</em></strong>

Sony gives us 3 main sections in the Chroma Key settings:  1) Chromakey, 2) Crop, and 3) Size/Position. I won’t spend too much time on the last 2, as they're fairly self-explanatory. In the main panel, though, we have some interesting choices. The “Auto” mode is very robust, and often gets it pretty close. When in auto mode, we are given a small white box on our main display to move around (I prefer using a mouse and keyboard when using the Touch, as it makes dragging this box around much easier than using your finger). I find that selecting the darker spots of your green/blue screen produce the best results -- though lighting your screen evenly is always recommended. Even so, I’ve gotten some remarkable results from wrinkled and uneven lighting -- there is enough forgiveness here for users of all levels to give it a shot.

Color Cancel is a great addition by Sony -- it is your basic “spill suppression.” Instead of adding magenta to green, though, it simply finds any leftover areas of the sampled color and desaturates them.  This is fantastic for tough keys with fairer skin and lighter hair. I wish there were ways to adjust the amount of hue and luma for the key’s selection, but, even without it, it seems to work very intuitively. Sometimes, if your talent is wearing darker clothing, this can present itself as a fine grey outline. Fiddling with the manual gain and density adjustments is usually enough to get it passable.

Disable Colors will help you select as to whether you want to composite your title graphics, or have them overlay as normal. Not much to worry about here - basic rule of thumb is to leave it be unless your titles are behaving strangely.

My recommended workflow for keying is to use auto mode to get you in the ballpark - if you’ve lit your screen fairly well, you often won’t need to mess with anything else. If you’re finding issue, switching to manual will save the auto settings, then adjusting the Clip slider is usually enough to get you the rest of the way there.

Here’s a photo of the test we set up:

<strong><em><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_65531.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1491" title="IMG_6553" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_65531-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>
</em></strong>

I tried to emulate a portable, lower budget situation for users who would be on location, streaming live to the web or to internal monitors. We used a collapsible Chroma Key flex-fill, clamped to a few C-Stands. For lighting, I threw up some Litepanels 1x1’s, with full diffusion and ¼ CTO to keep the greens looking green. For our single key light, I used the Litepanels Ringlite Mini. A small LED light would be a great addition to this set up for some fill light, but I tried to keep things simple. Our camera? Your standard Canon 5D mkIII with a 24-70mm, stopped down to f4. Here’s a still from this setup, with our own Jenn Jennings reading the weather!

<strong><em><a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jenn_key01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1493" title="jenn_key01" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jenn_key01-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>
</em></strong>

<strong><em>
</em></strong>

You can see that even with a very basic set up, you can get a pretty convincing chroma key up and running without too much fuss. Green screen live can be a great tool for corporate productions, broadcast situations, and webcasts. It can also be a great way to easily get a visually interesting interview background when space and budget is limited.

In addition to the traditional chroma key situations, one can also use chromakey for using animated titles. The Anycast Touch, at the end of the day, is still a switcher, and switchers are always going to be limited in certain ways. With the Touch, we are unable to import animated graphics into the internal SSD for use in the titling section. Even when exported with an alpha channel, the Touch can’t process it. By using chromakey, however, we are able to circumvent this limitation. We can use the internal media player and chromakey effect to knock out the background, and use live animated graphics. In this way, your graphics are really limited only by your graphic designer’s talents!

<strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/89003863" target="_blank">Here's a video sample</a> </strong>using a gaudy animated lower third I threw together in After Effects. Exported as a simple MP4, I used a highly saturated green as the background.

The Touch removes it perfectly on the auto setting, and we're able to use animations to really raise production value. The added text has been created and faded on using the Anycast Touch title interface.

Perfect for sports when you need to throw back to instant replay, probably having two opposing team’s helmets smash into one another and explode. Or maybe a robot doing jumping jacks. You get the idea.  The one drawback to this workflow is that Sony only allows you to have a single media player for internal video at a time -- so by using it up on the animation, we can no longer put an internal video behind it at the same time internally. Not the end of the world, or even a common situation, but definitely food for thought.

So there you have it. Not so bad, right? With just a flex-fill green screen, a couple lights and a DSLR, you can add tons of production value to both small and large scale productions. I’ll be covering a whole lot more in my Learning Lab on March 26th, so be sure to RSVP: events@rule.com to get the nitty-gritty details on this cool new product.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The F55 and F5 are really something.  Just when you think you know them, there's another update!  For over a year now, the F55 and F5 have been steadily making their way on a pre-planned firmware path that continuously adds to what these cameras can do.  No other camera has gestated outside of the factory as long as these have.  Version 3.0 was going to finish the cameras but then 4.0 was announced and the cameras just keep giving!  The number of codecs (XAVC, MPEG50, SR, RAW and now ProRes and DNxHD!), frame rates (up to 180 internal and 240 on R5), and mount options (PL, F, B4, EF, etc.) make the F55 and F5 the most versatile cameras on the market.  It's that flexibility, however, that can make them a little tricky to learn at first. Version 3.0 has been out for a little while so we've had some time to suss it out. We invite you to another F55/F5 demo in our Showroom on Wednesday, March 26th at 12PM to learn more.

<strong>3.0 Stand-Out Features:</strong>

Apply, route, and record a variety of LUTs, e.g., shoot RAW and simultaneously record S-log with or without a LUT baked in on SxS.  You can even use Sony's free software, Raw Viewer, to create your own 1D LUTs to load into the camera.

2K Center Scan mode is not to be overlooked.  Normally, you're always using the full Super 35 4K CMOS sensor regardless of what resolution you want to shoot.  Windowing in on the sensor, though, allows the ability to use Super 16mm lenses which offers more choices for look, cost, and weight.  This is a great feature that got a lot of people's attention.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/f5w16mm1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1526" title="*f5w16mm" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/f5w16mm1-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" /></a>

The new color space option, S-Gamut3/S-Log3 offers a more filmic curve that allows more detail in shadows and the application of standard LUTS, not necessarily made by Sony.  S-log 2 allows more information in the highlights, i.e., you can overexpose slightly with 2 and underexpose slightly with 3.

		<title>Production LEDs in a New Light with Zylight&#039;s F8</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>UPDATE ON 5/12/14:  Since my original post below, I've learned that the F8's bellows are actually made from silicone which should last significantly longer than rubber and that a redesigned yoke was already shown at NAB.  Zylight's on the ball! </strong>

<strong></strong>We've all heard about the merits of LED lighting (low power draw, low heat, no bulb changing, etc.), but for the reality of production work, there were always major trade-offs. The throw of an LED light was useless unless you were right up on the talent, their color rendition was poor and their tell-tale multi-shadows were garbage.  LEDs were rightly relegated to being just an easy fill option or kick light.  Even their flicker free qualities were limited by their low output which is not what you need for high frame rate shooting.  Despite a larger power draw and the heat, you were always better off using tungsten or HMI. Zylight's F8, though, finally spoils us.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ZylightF8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1537" title="*ZylightF8" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ZylightF8-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>

This is a focusable fresnel LED fixture (70° flood and 16° spot) that is lightweight, can be powered for over an hour with a standard camera battery, and has the equivalent throw of a traditional 650w tungsten head. I had to break out a light meter to see the proof in lux for myself.  Not to be overlooked is the distinct, single shadow you get from this instrument. You can order the F8 as 5600K or 3200K.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/02Lust-ZylightF8-4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1538" title="*02Lust-ZylightF8-4" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/02Lust-ZylightF8-4-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184" /></a>
<div>Admittedly, the F8 is a little pricey at $2,400.00 but remember that tungsten replacement bulbs aren't cheap and neither is your electric bill if you have a studio.  The fact that you can just slap a dionic on the back and you're good to go anywhere is amazing.  Save yourself from that heavy sack pack of stingers and dimmers.  I appreciate the retracting bellows design that squeezes this unit down to just a few inches thick.  The bellows are rubber, though, so there is the concern of hardening and cracks over time.  The yoke definitely needs a redesign.  Rosettes are for tripods and handles, not lights.  Having two separate rosette mounts to deal with every time you need to make adjustments is annoying.  Flicker free dimming from 0-100% from a small knob in the back or through DMX is a nice feature.  Zylight is very proud of their "Zylink" wireless control control capability but in practice, I could take or leave that feature.  I noticed a USB 3.0 port behind the fresnel lens so who knows what else is to come through firmware.  All things considered, the F8 is already a staple in our lighting inventory here at Rule and once you try it, you'll be asking for it again and again.</div>

		<title>The Panasonic GH4: An Analysis (Part 1 of 2)</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1546</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[DSLR enthusiasts and 4K adopters alike have all been talking nonstop about the new Panasonic GH4; the tiny camera that can do 4K internally, high speeds up to 96fps, and some very high bit rates. Panasonic has taken the queues from its users who have in the past hacked and modded the GH series cameras to suit their needs. The GH4 does everything they’ve asked for, and Panasonic has come out strong with a very interesting 4K camera - but how does it perform in the real world?

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GH4.1.Blog-pic.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1548" title="GH4.1.Blog pic" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GH4.1.Blog-pic-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Size</span></strong>
The GH4 is small. Real small. As you can see in the photo above, even with some rigging it maintains a small profile. Compared to the Canon 5D Mark III at around 2lbs, the GH4 squeaks in at a svelte 1.2lbs. The additional YAGH bottom unit will add a bit of heft to the camera, but at the end of the day it is one of the smaller DSLR’s out there. This can be a good or bad thing, all depending on your situation. For me, the flip out screen and small form factor are fantastic for run and gun situations, specifically in crowded areas or in public. It’s small and lightweight, but packs a punch with its recording quality. The small size will lend itself nicely to stabilizers of all types - including the new Movi M5 (available to buy or rent here at Rule!).

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imager and Recording</span></strong>

The GH4 is another camera in a long line of Micro Four Thirds (MFT) size sensors. MFT is an interesting sensor size. Compared to the Full Frame Canon DSLRs, the crop factor can be intimidating (2.1x, thereabouts). Those of us familiar with shooting with the Blackmagic Cinema Cameras won’t be too surprised, but it can be a shock to some. When using S35 glass, like our beautiful Zeiss Super Speeds, the crop shrinks down to a manageable 1.4x - making the field of view on a 50mm look more like the field of view of a 70mm. Something shooters of the C100, C300 and other APS-C canon cameras will be very familiar with.

Aside from the crop, the image produced by the GH4 is impressive. It’s no low-light monster like the Canon 1DC - I don’t find ISO values higher than 1600 usable without heavy noise reduction and post work, compared to the 10,000 ISO on the 1DC that I’ve filmed with comfortably in the past. I find the standard ISO 800 values to be pleasing, but find that the shadows can still present some blocky looking noise artifacts. This can usually be graded out easily, but it’s important to remember that this isn’t a 1DC, and you’re going to have to take care when shooting dim scenes.

The GH4 does not have an official “Log” setting, as the 1DC does - but I find one can get very close when using the Cinelike D profile. I’ve altered my settings slightly to present a slightly more flat and dynamic range friendly profile. By lowering the in camera noise reduction, sharpening, and saturation, I find you can squeeze a bit more information into the recording. I also use the master pedestal setting to raise the blacks up (+15 in camera menu). I find this to be very near to a proper log setting. In DaVinci Resolve, using the Arri Alexa LUTs shows just how close it can be - though you should bump the saturation down a bit more before applying.

Below is a very quick test I did here at the Rule office. Shot in very bright mid-day sunlight, I tried to see how well the camera would capture detail and dynamic range. You can see it holds up well. The camera loves daylight, far more than tungsten. Though the 4K is only recorded at a variable bitrate, maxing at 100Mbps, it seems to handle detail and movement well. It is able to capture the bright blue sky, as well as plenty of shadow detail. It’s not RAW, like the Blackmagic counterparts, but you can record around 80 minutes of 4K video on a 64GB card - compared to the Blackmagic Pocket Camera that can give you around 20-30 minutes of Prores, or 15 or so minutes of RAW 1080p. Puts it all into perspective, doesn’t it?

<strong><a title="Panasonic GH4: First Tests" href="http://vimeo.com/96846791" target="_blank">Click here for "Panasonic GH4: First Tests" on Vimeo.</a></strong>

The GH4 is also capable of outputting a 10bit 4:2:2 signal via HDMI. This disables the internal recording, but allows for very high quality Prores recordings with the Odyssey 7Q. While it can be a bit of a runaround getting from Micro-HDMI to Mini-HDMI, the image quality is striking. The Odyssey 7Q’s monitor is also a miracle when shooting, and a welcomed respite from using the small 3” flip out LCD screen.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1550" title="GH4.2.Blog" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GH4.2.Blog_1-e1401475452186-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1551" title="GH4.2.blog pic" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GH4.2.blog-pic-e1401475486634-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />

The added focus peaking, zebra, and histogram functions also make shooting life easier. The GH4 does internally offer peaking, zebra, and histogram - but none perform quite as nicely as that of the 7Q.

Stay tuned for a follow up blog post with some more footage and examples, as well as the GH4 Learning Lab I’ll be presenting June 25th here at Rule Boston Camera!

		<title>The Quest for Knowledge (aka Summer Intern Highlights so far)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's hard to think of something specific I'd like to say about the intern program at Rule. This is because I've gotten to do, see, and learn about tons of stuff in the really short time I've been here. I'm getting my hands on equipment I would, otherwise, have had to wait ages just to lay a finger on. I’m learning from some really promising and accomplished individuals about the scenes in Boston and New England, and getting to know names and faces. I'm navigating the streets of downtown with kits and cams in the back of the van, on our way to Boston film and videomaking offices I never even knew existed; and when we get there, people are really excited to see us.

While it’s difficult to abstain from geeking out over being in the same vicinity as ARRI Alexa's, Cooke lenses and all the amazing stuff that goes with them, I think I'll say one of my favorite things about the internship so far is interacting with the folks who use this stuff, and seeing what everyone's renting. One guy rented a bunch of lights and when I asked him how everything worked out, he gave me details about his set and his weekend shoot. It made my day!

As an intern, I’m a little sponge – offer even the smallest amount of info or knowledge, and it’ll be well absorbed for future use. It’s one thing to soak in all the theories and reviews and instructional videos, but as a growing gear nerd, it makes all the difference to hold the stuff, figure it out and see how it works.  And as someone anxious to absorb, it's really cool to invite all the rental drop-offers to tell me how their shoots went. I want to know what they're doing and how they're doing it, and I feel really encouraged as an intern to get them to tell me just a little bit about it.

In the shop the other day, I got to learn about a Steadicam Zephyr which was gear-nerd-monumental because it’s a vital piece of equipment to filmmaking (especially now that I’m much more ready to operate my own one day).  And of course it’s just plain cool.

[caption id="attachment_1561" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Interns Mike and Cat with QC&#39;s Kevin Bueschen"]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.19.14.CatBlog.5D3_9025.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1561" title="6.19.14.CatBlog.5D3_9025" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.19.14.CatBlog.5D3_9025-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]

I’m really looking forward to continuing the quest for knowledge, and to sharing more and more stuff that I learn about – the Panasonics, the REDs, the MoVI-- you name it. To me, though, every piece of equipment I touch at Rule is awesome and important, from the Sachtler to the Kino to the Steadicam, because eventually it’ll all come together to make something really inspiring for the sponges like me!

		<title>The Kessler CineDrive: A Robot with A Mind of Its Own?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Actually it's a little more complicated than that. The CineDrive is a multi-axis motion control system that lets you pan, tilt, slide, zoom and even focus your camera. This piece of gear brings a whole new meaning to the word MOTION for your film or project.

With one look at the CineDrive, the first thing that will come to mind is "WOW, with so many moving parts and connections, I'll never be able to learn all this".  Actually, the CineDrive is only as complicated as you make it -- from a simple sliding and panning motion to a whole 6-hour time lapse that includes the zoom function -- it's really all about the type of shot you hope to achieve.

With shot options including live-action, time-lapse and stop-motion, any of these settings will help your project come to life via motion.  How?  The CineDrive runs off software called kOS which can be controlled through an IPAD, PC or MAC.  This software communicates with the CineDrive's main system called "The Brain".  The Brain produces its own WIFI just like the GoPro.  You can connect the IPAD app wirelessly to the system, or if you don't have WIFI, the Brain has an Ethernet port for a direct connection from your laptop.

In order for the motor to work, the Brain is connected to motor control boxes (MCB), with each box designated with a different function including zoom, focus or slide. The pan/tilt functions are part of the main system so there are no extra boxes for pan/tilt. It also comes with a couple of different motors -- one for the slide, one for the zoom function (for your lens), and another for focus. With all these options, there are endless possibilities for creating various shot movements.

When first testing the CineDrive with the IPAD app, I found out it does not work well with the first generation IPADs, so you'll want to make sure your IPAD or operating system is up-to-date.  The kOS app is frequently updated because it's still considered pretty new.

The weight limit is around 15 pounds! That's actually a lot if you think about it since you won't need a monitor on the camera with the CineDrive staying in one spot. For one of my tests with the CineDrive, I used the TS3Cine high-speed camera, and the ports were a little difficult to attach a monitor while also getting the SD card in and out.

When people see the CineDrive they also think they need a slider, but (good news!), the CineDrive comes with a 100mm bowl mount that fits on tripod legs e.g., the Video 18 or Video 20.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1580" title="Export.7340.CineDrive" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Export.7340.CineDrive-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

When using the CineDrive with a camera like the 5D Mark III or 7D, you can create a time-lapse with photos in the kOS software, giving you the ability to set the number of photos you want to take within a certain amount of time. For example, say you want to take 1000 photos in 2 hours with a set frame rate.  All you need is a simple cable connection to make it happen!

The Kessler CineDrive is great for filmmakers who enjoy the more technical aspect of shooting.  While a good amount of preparation goes into the set-up, you have a good number of options and flexibility.   RSVP: events@rule.com for my upcoming Learning Lab with the CineDrive on Wednesday, July 23rd from 10am-12n.  If you can't make it in person, you can watch it later on our vimeo channel at https://vimeo.com/channels/rulelearninglabseries.

		<title>The Concept of Ease in Filmmaking</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the place I am now, having recently graduated, looking/hoping/begging for work, and getting this internship and blog to learn from and play with, I feel privileged and prepared to go ahead and share a very quick reflection on a concept that I, and I’m sure countless others, have faithfully explored, willingly embraced, and so readily attempted to reject: ease. What follows are just some thoughts and ruminations, from an RBC intern, on the concept of ease in filmmaking.

As I think and I ruminate, I am inspired by one of the coolest pieces of equipment I’ve been introduced to at Rule, the Kessler CineDrive: an amazing genius robot helper for all your pans, tilts, slides and more. Coming from a class of filmmakers rightfully obsessed with finding unique, professional, and visually stunning ways to capture the simplest and most complex of modern moments, the possibilities here, the ease with which we can achieve them, and the overall potential that the CineDrive represents are enormous!

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SR9C5539.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1589" title="SR9C5539" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SR9C5539-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>

I’ve also been inspired by another one of the coolest pieces of equipment I’ve been presented with at Rule, the Arri 416 HS Plus 16mm film camera. It’s beautiful. I’ve gotten to experiment with 16mm film just one other very brief time in my life, and because of cameras like this, it sucks to think that the slowly dying “film” in “film school” could soon breathe it’s last breath. I’m very thankful that there are places that still have the resources to teach about film and encourage it to be used.  I don’t mean to say that shooting on film is at the other end of a spectrum, or that it’s necessarily hard, but it is kind of painstaking!  It's also really different from what I and my generation has gotten used to.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_7931.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1590" title="IMG_7931" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_7931-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

On shoots that I’ve been on and helped with, I always find myself wishing things could be a little easier, move faster, or become magically convenient. Hopefully, I’m not alone in this, but then I look at the crazy cardboard/tape/black wrap/diffusion thing in front of me and realize that ease is awesome, but so is hard work. The experience that has made me seriously crave the endless touch-ups and touchiest set-ups of each and every film set has been this internship. Knowing and learning about the tools to achieve ease, perfection -- or dare I say both -- has proven invaluable, making me that much more passionate about making movies. It’s also been really wonderful to be exposed to an evolution of filmmaking though RBC, because when I’m around people whose job it is to know the ins and outs of decades of equipment, it becomes fascinating to compare a modern marvel like the CineDrive, if it could be representative of the ease a filmmaker might, deep down, die for, to something like a 16mm film camera, if it could be representative of the perpetual fragility and exhaustion of filmmaking, as well as the amazing reward that results.

		<title>Up Close with Canon&#039;s New Line of Cine Primes &amp; Zooms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In July, Nick Giannino from our sales dept and myself were kindly invited down to Canon HQ in Long Island for an educational seminar. The aim was to talk about Canon's new line of Cine primes and zooms. About half the seminar was conducted by Mitch Gross, formerly of Abel in New York. He asked what makes a great cinema lens as opposed to a great still lens? Good question - how about long focus pull range; large, glow-in-the-dark focus markings; 11 iris blades to produce subtle bokeh; warm skin tone glass; and ability to handle flares.  All these factors have been built into both the Cine EF-mount primes and the PL-mount zooms.

[caption id="attachment_1594" align="alignleft" width="287" caption="Nick and Andrew at Camp Canon"]<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8242.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1594" title="IMG_8242" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8242-287x300.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

The second half of the seminar was conducted by Suny Behar. He conducts a week-long camera test every year for HBO. What camera test, you ask? Well, HBO is the only network that does this: they spend a week with six different cameras, from a Black Magic 4K to a Phantom Flex 4K, shooting footage under a variety of different lighting situations. This footage is then shown to HBO show runners and DPs who are in the process of making camera decisions for upcoming shows.  This year all the lenses used on all these camera tests were from the EF and PL-mount Canon Cine line. The lenses were chosen over Cookes, Optimos, Zeiss, etc.  HBO was very impressed. In fact, so impressed was David Franco, a DP on <em>Game Of Thrones, </em> he went out and bought the entire Canon Cine line. I heard he paid with golden blood-soaked coins.

Lastly, Canon also showed off the new Cine 17-120mm ENG-style large-sensor zoom lens which will be shipping in September. The lens is designed to be a Cabrio-killer with a larger zoom range, better ergonomics and a price point $15K cheaper than the Fuji Cabrio 19-90mm.

Lots of low-interest rate options are available for the C300, C500 and lens packages so ask Sales for details. We also have most of the Canon Cine line available in rentals so please call us for availability and pricing.

Thanks for reading!

		<title>The Panasonic GH4: An Analysis (Part 2 of 2)</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1600</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2014 20:06:57 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last post, I talked all about the versatility of the GH4, and how it can bring some pro features to a semi-pro audience -- as well as some pro features to some budget-conscious professionals! In this piece, I’ll be talking a little bit more about some of the higher-end applications of the GH4, as well as its partner in crime - the YAGH interface. (Catchy name, right?)

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gh4yagh_01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1601" title="GH4.1" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gh4yagh_01-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

The YAGH interface unit, or “the bottom thing” as most folks around here are calling it, adds some really fantastic usability to the system. Firstly, it provides HD-SDI connectivity. To my knowledge, there is <strong>no other</strong> DSLR on the market that currently sports HD-SDI, unless you get into Blackmagic Cinema Camera territory <em>(Yes, I realize the GH4 isn’t technically a DSLR, nor are the BMCCs - but work with me here)</em>. This is a big deal. Not only do we get HD-SDI, but we are given 4 HD-SDI ports. The photo above shows how when paired with something like an AJA Ki Pro Quad, we can record 10bit 422 HQ Prores 4K footage. That’s some serious codec right there. The quad also mounts nicely to the rear on rods, allowing for easy powering with an Anton Bauer d-tap. Add a top handle, and I could see someone shooting with this for very long periods for indie cinema, documentary, or commercial applications.

In addition to HD-SDI, we are also given 2 XLR inputs and a full-sized HDMI output - still capable of outputting 4K 10bit. With the added XLR, HD-DI, and 4pin DC power - this is all of a sudden a real, professional camera.

There are, however, some drawbacks to this unit. First and foremost, most people will be surprised to find out that once the YAGH unit is installed, all your power must come from an external source. For the setup, I like to hang a Wooden Camera Anton Bauer gold mount rod unit to the rear, pulling off the d-tap and into the 4pin XLR. This isn’t that bad, but it’s to be noted. All those nice new Panasonic badged batteries you got for the camera? Yeah, those aren’t gonna work with the YAGH.

The only other real problem I’ve found with the YAGH unit is simply misinformation. One DOES NOT NEED the YAGH unit to output 4K via HDMI into something like an Atomos Shogun. What the YAGH does give you is a full-sized HDMI, proper HD-SDI connections, XLR, audio levels on nice easy-to-see LEDS, and a way to power the camera with a big Anton Bauer battery. Professional users will see these things not as detriments, but as huge improvements. Users who require a slimmer profile, and easier rig, will find themselves opting out of the YAGH unit. Each situation will require some foresight into exactly what you will need - but Panasonic has given us the choice, and that’s saying a lot more than any other camera in this market.

Now, with all that being said - this brings me to the next situation people are speaking at length about: External recording with the GH4. While the option to output such high spec codecs is phenomenal, one must again consider their application in what you’re really shooting. In my personal tests, I’ve found the native 4K 100Mbps internal recording to be nothing short of amazing. It hits that beautiful sweet spot between compression and high bit rates -- it gives just enough to allow for some flexibility in color grades, but compresses enough to give you 40 minutes of 4K video per 32GB card. I was getting around half an hour per 64GB card recording prores on my Blackmagic Pocket Cam. There’s really something to be said about smart compression. There has always been the cry for uncompressed, but not nearly a loud enough cry for BETTER compression.

<a href="https://vimeo.com/95519345"><strong>This video</strong></a>, shot by vimeo user Emeric, displays just how pretty this camera can be! He lists the lenses as very common Panasonic and Olympus glass, recorded internally and graded in film convert. Take a look and see if you’d be kicking yourself for not recording to a Shogun! (I wouldn’t.)

Lastly, I want to quickly touch on one more aspect of the camera that I believe needs to be spoken about a bit more. The versatility of the MFT mount. The small flange distance allows us to adapt this mount to most anything -- though an optimal Canon EF adapter is still slightly difficult. With the introduction of speed boosters, we are seeing some really amazing things happen. Nikon mount Zeiss glass being adapted and reduced, gaining a stop with no optical quality loss. It’s very exciting! Our GH4 has gone out the door a handful of times loaded up with Zeiss Superspeeds and even some Cooke Glass. I feel that in a rental situation, this camera is allowing people the budgetary option of scaling back the camera body, perhaps down from a 1DC or c300, and scaling up that savings into some absolutely exceptional glass. Here’s a photo of the GH4 fitted with the new Leica Summicron-C 35mm. These lenses are smaller than Cookes, and fit very nicely onto the Hotrod MFT to PL adapter.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gh4_2_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1602" title="*gh4_2" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gh4_2_blog-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

The instance of lower-cost cameras introducing professional codec options and video features, like peaking, zebra, HD-SDI, xlr, etc., are allowing low-budget shooters to experiment with something that will surely improve your image -- the glass in front of the sensor. It is in this that I find the GH4 to be a big deal, giving you options for a high-end studio shoot with an Optimo zoom, feeding a director's monitor; or in your backpack with a pancake lens, for quick shooting while on vacation.

The GH4, as well as the YAGH unit, Hotrod PL adapter, and a whole host of lenses are all here at Rule Boston Camera for rental - and we also offer the GH4 and YAGH for purchase, if you’re so inclined. Happy shooting!

		<title>The Sony a7s: Full Frame, Low Light Monster</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, here we are with me talking about a new small camera that everyone in the indie shooting world seems to be going bananas over! Similarly to when the GH4 launched (of which you can read my latest blog post by clicking <a title="click here" href="http://www.rule.com/blog/index.php/2014/08/the-panasonic-gh4-an-analysis-part-2-of-2/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>here</strong></span></a>) -- there has been an extreme amount of chatter about this new Sony camera. Is it worth the hype?

Upon launch, it was touted as the end-all-be-all of DSLR cameras (yes, I know it’s not technically a DSLR!), and a direct competitor to Panasonic’s GH4. Both cameras are mirrorless, seem to have more than a few nods to video users, and come in at a fairly affordable price point. After those features, however, the similarities stop. The two cameras are very different animals -- both with their own strange strengths and weaknesses.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1.vscocam_1407872146.069169.20.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1610" title="*1.vscocam_1407872146.069169.20" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1.vscocam_1407872146.069169.20-e1410208572470-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><strong></strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Family Tree</span></strong>
The a7s succeeds two other cameras in the Sony lineup that, at a glance, seem the same. The a7, and a7r. The design of these cameras comes from almost a rangefinder idea -- a small, street photographers secret weapon. And for stills, no one was going to argue the quality. I’m sure even Fuji was taking notice. When it came to video, however, the quality and feature set wasn’t anything to write home about. While the a7r matched that of the 5dIII in most instances, Canon had already bundled up the market years ago. The a7s, though, has built upon this small form factor and has pushed the video feature set to its ends. It continues with the full-frame-sized sensor, but in this case it seems to be an entirely new chip.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low Light</span></strong>
While I’m not in love with the form factor of this tiny camera (I’ve got big, dumb hands), the image quality is staggering. Particularly, with its low-light capabilities. The color and detail data it is able to pull from near total darkness at ISO’s of 20,000 and even 50,000 is unlike any camera I’ve ever seen, in any market or price range. This isn’t just a low-light camera, it’s a night-vision camera. Take a look at <a href="https://vimeo.com/99676933"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">this great test from James Miller</span></strong></a> -- that blue sky you see is actually a night sky. Those green bushes? Dark splotches to the human eye.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SLOG 2 &amp; Grading </span></strong>
Now, we aren’t all nature photographers who need to see into the dead of night all the time -- so upon getting the camera in my hands, my first tests were tried and true charts. I was overjoyed to see SLOG 2 and S-Gammut profiles included in the kit. This camera is cheaper than a 5dIII, but it's now including a log profile that was at one time a paid upgrade to the F3 camera?! Count me in! I set up my chart, brought my middle grey down to 35%, and threw on my SLOG2 luts. You know, the ones I’ve been using for the past 4 years! And wouldn’t you know, it looked… terrible.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4.slog2_35_pic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1613" title="*4.slog2_35_pic1" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4.slog2_35_pic1-177x300.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="300" /></a>

What?! What happened? Why were my shadows so grainy and noisy? I thought this was a low-light monster! I couldn’t understand it. After some more research and testing, I figured it out.

SLOG 2 on the a7s rates the native ISO of the sensor at 3200 ISO - as opposed to say 2000 on the fs700 and f5, or 1250 on the f55. As this is a different sensor, it is handling its color science differently. I found that it is so light sensitive, the sensor prefers to be fed LOTS of light - to the point of seemingly over-exposing the image. I found that middle grey likes to live around 75%, rather than 35%. As the camera only provides zebras and a meter internally for exposure help, it’s perhaps easiest to set your zebra level to 95% or 100%, and ride the high end until right before clipping. Bringing the color and gamma down works like a charm, and in no time I had the chart performance I had expected:

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2.slog2_75_pic2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1611" title="*2.slog2_75_pic2" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2.slog2_75_pic2-177x300.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="300" /></a>

So perhaps this isn’t the same old same old SLOG 2 I had assumed - but once I figured out the optimal settings, I was very impressed. The dynamic range on this camera is very high, around 14 actual usable stops. That gets into high-end cinema camera territory.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4K Recording &amp; XAVC-S</span></strong>
The last major feature of the a7s is the 4K external recording option. Now, first off, the a7s is using a brand new “consumer” version of the very popular XAVC codec. Internally, this high bitrate and smart compression is very malleable, especially for being at its base an h.264 MP4 file. It sports a very fiddly micro-HDMI port through which it will send 4K, 4:2:2 uncompressed video. The only thing headed to market soon that will handle this in a portable way will be the new Atomos Shogun - delivery date is still TBA.

I find time and time again that users can get hung up on external recording solutions. One should always push their internal codecs as far as they can to see where the line in the sand is going to be drawn, and I find XAVC-S and SLOG 2 to be a 1-2 punch when it comes to color grading. <a href="https://vimeo.com/102394016"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Here is a very pretty video from vimeo user Florian Knab</span></strong></a> -- check out how even the 120fps 720p looks great in a web delivery situation.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.vscocam_1409756234.366644.10.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1612" title="*3.vscocam_1409756234.366644.10" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.vscocam_1409756234.366644.10-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Thoughts</span></strong>
With SLOG 2, XAVC-S, a full-frame sensor, frightening low-light sensitivity, and an easily adaptable E-Mount - I think the a7s is a great addition to the indie market. I wish it were able to record 4K internally and high-speed above 60fps at 1080 like its mirrorless GH4 counterpart - but even without these features, it’s a pretty fantastic little camera. If you’d like to learn a bit more about the a7s, my post workflow, and other ways to get the most out of it, be sure to check out my Learning Lab here at Rule Boston Camera on 9/24 at 10am.  If you can't make it in person, you'll find it on our <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/rulelearninglabseries"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/rulelearninglabseries">Learning Lab Vimeo Channel</a> afterwards.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kino Flo introduced its first LED light, the Celeb 200, in September 2012, followed by the Celeb 400 in April 2014.  Rule Boston Camera proudly welcomes these two new lights to our inventory!  We love Kino Flo’s products for their light, robust housing, ease of use, and cool, silent, consistent operation.  Kino Flo has incorporated the quality and convenience we have come to expect into their new LED line, and once again dazzled us with beautifully soft, even light and reliable design.

The Celebs differ from their fluorescent cousins by offering even more convenience – no external ballast, no head or harness cables, and no bulbs!  One provided AC cable is all you need to brighten up the set (these lights are also capable of running off 24V DC power).  The built-in ballast controls power as well as Kelvin temperature and dimming, while an LED display reads its current values.  The single panel of LEDs has a range of 2700 Kelvin to 5500 Kelvin.  There are five preset Kelvin temperatures (2700, 3200, 4000, 5000, 5500) that correspond to colored buttons on the ballast, or you can save your preferred temperatures to these buttons.  Temperature can be precisely dialed in by turning the knob on the right of the ballast.  Change the temperature by values of 100 degrees, or press the knob for fine values – depending on what end of the Kelvin spectrum you are in, the temperature increases by 10, 15, or 25 degrees.  There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the differences in increments, but there are plenty of options along the spectrum to choose from.  To dim the light, from a range of 0 to 100, simply press the Kelvin/Dim button and turn the knob.  Dimming can be changed from coarse (values of 4) to fine (values of 0.4) by pressing in the knob.  The Lock/Reset button will prevent your settings from accidentally being changed, or factory reset the Kelvin temperature presets.

The Celeb provides mounting flexibility – both the 200 and 400 come with the center ball mount we all know and love, giving the light a full 360-degree range of motion.  The 200 has a baby receiver, while the 400 has a baby receiver inside a junior pin.  Rule has a wide selection of C-stands and combo stands to choose from.  Both fixtures have molded corners with holes to mount the light with rope, and two handles on the back for safety chains and easy transport.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9798.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1630" title="IMG_9798" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9798-176x300.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="300" /></a>

The Celebs come with a gel frame and 90 degree honeycomb eggcrate louver.  Both mount to the fixture with spring-loaded clamps in the molded corners.  I’ve found the spring-loaded mount to be especially convenient.  The fluorescent lights have Velcro mounts that clasp into the eggcrate and often break.  The spring-loaded mount is easier, quicker, and more secure.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_98052.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1635" title="IMG_9805" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_98052-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>

The Celebs are an energy, cost, and time efficient light appropriate for all of your lighting needs.  Both Celebs boast flicker free operation and consistent color temperature while dimming.  The 200 draws 1 amp, while producing more lumens than a 750W fixture.  The 400 draws 1.8 amps, while producing more lumens than a 1K fixture.   Kino Flo’s fluorescents feature cool operation, but these LED fixtures emit practically no heat!  This means you can pick it up and adjust it without gloves, you don’t need to worry about burning your gels, and you can place it right into the flight case after striking it off.

Stop by or call us at Rule to add these versatile lights to your arsenal!

		<title>An Introduction to the Sony PXW-FS7</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1637</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 18:41:31 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As with all my blog posts, I’m happy to introduce you to yet another camera that’s being called “The Next Big Thing!” I’ve talked at length about the Panasonic GH4, the Sony a7s, and other <em>it</em> cameras that seemed to stir up buzz this past year. 2014 was a great year for new technology to find its way to lower price point cameras, and the culmination of that may be the new Sony FS7.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/fs7.blog-photo.12.11.14.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1642" title="fs7.blog photo.12.11.14" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/fs7.blog-photo.12.11.14-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

The FS7 was touted as being designed by Sony from “listening,” and I can’t argue with that. Professionals have been asking for an ergonomic, easy to use, high frame rate, 4K camera with built-in ND filters and all the bells and whistles one would come to expect from a professional camera. A large chip, easily adaptable mount - and a high quality internal codec. This list seems long and perhaps unattainable for a sub $10K camera, but all of those features have been delivered and met in the FS7.

First and foremost, some specs. The Sony FS7 has a s35 sized sensor, that seems to be almost identical to that of the Sony F5. In my book, this may be the best selling point of the camera. With this sensor, the FS7 is able to not only record UHD 4k to 2 different flavors of XAVC, but it can also shoot up to 180fps in HD. For low light, the sensor has a base ISO of 2000 - with some built-in ND filters to help you out. Standard XLR inputs, and even a nice arri style rosette for the very comfortable and easy to use side handle. This camera will most be compared to the wildly successful Canon C300 - but truth be told, the FS7’s got it beat in features. SLOG3 is available, as well as the highly gradable and precise Cine EI mode. This camera fits in line much closer to the F55 and F5 than it’s namesake, the FS700.

Unlike the FS700, the FS7 does not have a 3G SDI output on its standard body. Instead, a rear add-on unit is required to pass RAW out to something like the Odyssey 7Q. While this is sort of a bummer, the rear RAW unit also provides the ability to record ProRes directly to the cards internally - though XAVC is a very high bitrate codec itself.

After using the FS7 for a few weeks, all I can really say is that it more or less works as advertised. All the promises Sony made are delivered, and the camera works great. It’s comfortable, but could stand to use an additional shoulder pad to add some comfort. The battery times are very long, and the buttons on the camera are familiar and easy to find. The big credit most users gave to the Canon C300 was it’s ease of use, and good image. The FS7 meets that, and goes beyond. High frame rates are going to be the next big camera battleground in the next 5 years, and Canon’s 60FPS at 720p isn’t holding a candle to the FS7’s 60FPS at 4k, or 180FPS in HD.

I’ve run into a few small issues when adapting Canon lenses with the metabones speed boosters and smart adapters - but they are usable. Metabones released a firmware update for the speed booster ultra that seems to have helped it out - though operation still seems sluggish. These are nitpicking details, however.

If you’re curious about image quality, you can find plenty of beautiful examples all over the net as the camera is finding it’s way to shooters. And keep in mind, the image quality will be near identical to the Sony F5!

Here’s a really great video from vimeo user Joe Simon Films showcasing some of the FS7 abilities.

And here is a beautiful spot shot on the F5 from vimeo user Overseasfilms.com - pretty amazing that this image can now be captured by a camera that costs around 8 grand!

		<title>Fun New Features Come with the Latest Panasonic GH4 v2.2 Update</title>
		<link>http://ruletemp/?p=1644</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though I’ve already written about how head-over-heels I am for Panasonic’s overly affordable GH4, I thought I’d take some time to check in with the little wonder, and discuss some of the fun new features Panasonic has included! Earlier this spring, Panasonic released firmware version 2.2, and with it a slew of updates aimed squarely at the most fastidious gear nerds.

The Lumix series of cameras have long been championed by a loud minority - people hacking cameras, doing everything they could to squeeze the best possible image out of these cheap mirrorless cameras. With the GH4, that community has grown impressively. A subset of the micro four thirds folks, however, is that of the anamorphic shooters. For years people have been attaching old anamorphic projector lenses to adapters, rigging up double focus systems, and putting themselves through production hell - chasing that anamorphic image.

Panasonic has once again listened to their user base, and with their new release has enabled true 4:3 anamorphic recording for 2x lenses. Not something you see very often in price ranges below $40,000!

Below is a great lens test from vimeo user Sittipong Kongtong, comparing the lowly GH4 with the RED Dragon.

<a class="alignleft" title="Lens Test Comparison" href="https://vimeo.com/127348773" target="_blank"><strong>https://vimeo.com/127348773</strong></a>

Here’s another great interview with Panasonic from NAB, conducted by www.nofilmschool.com - giving a bit more insight into how it all works - as well as discussion on the upcoming firmware update that will allow true V-Log recording! V-Log will be coming straight from the Varicam 35, which is a surprising addition to a camera at such a low price point. For comparison, it’s not until the C100 level of camera that Canon offers a log profile. Panasonic continues to answer niche shooters' prayers.

<a class="alignleft" title="No Film School Interview with Panasonic at NAB" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=110&amp;v=rzaVp7cSaf4" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=110&amp;v=rzaVp7cSaf4</strong></a>

I will be hosting a Showroom Demo on the new firmware, as well as some color correction techniques for the GH4 on June 10th from 12:00pm-1:00pm here at Rule Boston Camera. Be sure to swing by!

		<title>Versatility is the Name of the Game with the Joker Line of Lighting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am excited to be writing my first HighOutput@Rule “Bright Ideas” blog post about some of my favorite lighting tools. The K5600 Joker line offers a large amount of versatility in a little package. Great things really do come in small packages! K5600 -- and now High Output -- offer 4 different models as part of the joker line.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_00691.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1652" title="IMG_0069" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_00691-300x200.jpg" alt="Alison.Joker1" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Whether you need a small beam of hard light in the background, or a nice, soft key light in a lantern or Softbank, the jokers can do it all.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joker3.IMG_0060-e1439833609866.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1654" title="Joker3.IMG_0060" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joker3.IMG_0060-e1439833609866-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

The 400w and the 800w are the most versatile of all because the technician set them up as a traditional par fixture using lenses to focus the beam. One can “bug” them by removing the reflector so that they can go into a Softbank or lantern and completely fill it out, one can utilize the bug-a-beam adapter to put the head inside of an ellipsoidal body which provides a sharp, focused beam or a bright pattern through a gobo, and, lastly, one can create a long, soft even source with the softube.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joker2_0034-e1439833201609.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1653" title="Joker2_0034" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joker2_0034-e1439833201609-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

Joker has recently released the 1600w version. This is a nice, compact fixture with a huge amount of light. It’s a great tool for shoots that take place in small spaces that require a lot of light.

Versatility is the name of the game with the joker line. You can bug them, diffuse them, and focus them. It’s the lighting world’s multi-purpose tool.

Thank you for reading!! Interested in renting one or more of the Joker's? Contact me by email at HighOutput@Rule.com or phone at 617-277-2200 x311 (or 800-rule-com).

Come see the Jokers up close during our Showroom Demo on Wednesday, August 26th from 12n to 1pm. RSVP: HighOutputEvents@Rule.com.

The Sound Advice Tour ended its tour in Boston MA and I was lucky enough to go and check it out. Being an audio guy I was really curious how he was going to explain and teach us things about audio for video. In the class there were way more video people than audio people, with all different levels of experience.

He first started by showing us clips of different movies he has done and showed us how much the audio impacts the movie as a whole and the slightest sound can change the whole setting. I was really impressed with how much work is really done for a feature length film and by the end you can end up with over hundreds of tracks for foley, music and sound effects.

Once we got more into the lecture he talked about how to record foley and what types of microphones to use in certain situations. For example if you are using a Sennheiser MKH 8060 out in the field to record your audio and you need to do ADR in the studio then you should use the exact same microphone in the studio so it has the same characteristics. He showed us a cool technique that when using an omni-directional microphone with a group of people walking and talking in circles around the microphone it creates a cool effect to where it seems like there are way more people in the setting than there actually is. This really blew my mind away, "DOPE".

We did talk a lot about equalization and cleaning up your audio in post. Cleaning up your audio really makes the voice stand out and removing unwanted noise in the background can really make a difference. The thing I was most excited about was learning how to get rid of that unwanted noise that comes from having a microphone on a boom pole. I always kind of knew how to get rid of it but the way he showed us really blew my mind and really helped me out for my future projects.

If you don't have the software called RX4 by iZotope and you are doing audio for videos then I highly recommend you get this. This software’s algorithm is highly advanced and can do just about anything from de-noising, to a simple EQ clean up and even de-reverbing! "WHAT?!?!" Yeah this software can really do it all and will make your films stand out from the rest of them. I went home and bought it that same day because I was so amazed by it.

We also learned the three aspects of music that can really help your film because you do not want some horror type music in an epic fight scene it just doesn't make sense. First you have your rhythm, your fight or flight. Second is melody, the thematic recall. Third you have the harmony, the emotional core of music. Most of the time there are two of these happening at a given time.

Another good tip for everyone out there bad foley is better than no foley even if it is recorded on your iPhone still use it, it will help you out in the end. But remember mix it low and give it some EQ because those couple of steps are better heard low than not being there at all.

After the whole class I learned a lot and recommend anyone check out Mark Edward Lewis's class if you get a chance he really explains everything in depth and he really engages the audience.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is literally the most flexible light in the world of entertainment lighting! The Bi-Color Flexlite, released in April of this year by Aladdin USA, is a light everyone should be using on every shoot. When I say “literally” I mean the fixture can actually bend to fit the contour of a column or the ceiling of a car. The Bi-Color Flexlite is so light and malleable that you can tape it to a column or to the ceiling of a car without any other type of support. Crazy, right? But "literally" true.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0463.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1678" title="Alison - Car 2" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0463-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>

Need the light to be daylight balanced to boost the ambient daylight from the windshield of a car? No problem. Switching color temperature is a breeze with the turn of a dial! Use gaffers tape to tape the unit to the ceiling of a car or the inside of a windshield. And don’t worry about power availability -- you can run it off a battery. As an LED, it will run for an hour on a 90wh battery or 2 hours on a 180Wh battery.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0480.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1677" title="Alison - Car" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0480-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>

The “flexibility” doesn’t stop there…the accessories available for this fixture can support any situation. Do you need a lightweight lantern in a limited power situation? Just strap on gold mounted batteries and set it up with the custom-built lantern. The lantern just pops open into shape when you remove it from the bag -– it can be set up in a matter of seconds. Don’t have a c-stand or maffer clamp? Hang the Bi-Color Flexlite in its lantern anywhere. The kit comes with a dual magnet mount so it can be mounted onto any metal surface.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0392.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1679" title="Alison - Showroom" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0392-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

The kit is full of useful accessories in addition to the dual magnet mount. Included is a baby pin adapter to set it up directly on a stand. Additionally, there is a soft box with no support rods or speed rings – the soft box just affixes via Velcro directly to the back of the light. The front diffusion piece sits approximately 4" above the Bi-Color Flexlite panel. This creates a beautiful, soft light.

<a href="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0293.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1680" title="Alison - Soft box" src="http://www.rule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMGL0293-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

Have you been concerned about the green shift in LED lighting? Well, not any more! This light reads  like a dream on the CRI with even, white light – no valleys and no peaks. Check out this photometrics chart from the Aladdin website:

</table>
But wait, there's more... I just can't say enough great things about this fixture. The Bi-Color Flexlite is splash and rainproof too – they have conducted tests submerging the fixture in pools and an aquarium. <strong>BUT, do be careful,</strong> as the dimmer and power unit are not splash/rainproof and will need to be protected.

This light can be used in so many different ways that I wouldn't want to be on set without at least one of these.

Two important features make this possible - the sophisticated built-in line converters and the high-resolution internal processing. Additionally, the program can be output from a variety of interfaces including the standard analog composite, S-Video, DV, and optionally SDI using the BKAW-580 for video, or High Definition analog component outputs of either 1080i or 720p using the optional BKAW-560 interface module, and D-Sub 15-pin outputs for projectors and large screen displays. Multi-format combinations SD (NTSC or PAL), HD (1080i or 720p), PC RGB (XGA and SXGA) signals, can all be mixed together and output as SD (NTSC or PAL), HD (1080i or 720p), and Video or PC RGB (XGA or SXGA) signal. Flexible video input configurations The Anycast Station offers the following video and PC inputs. These are provided as interface modules installed in the slots of its rear panel:Primary inputs 1 to 4: Analog composite, S-Video, DV Primary inputs 5 to 6: RGB (VGA, XGA, SXGA)Should a different input configuration be required, the interface modules are also provided as optional accessories, allowing users to configure the system exactly as required. What's more, the Anycast Station allows each input on these modules to be assigned to any one of the primary inputs via simple menu settings. Multi-camera ISO recording for use as a nonlinear editing source During a live event, each signal source supplied to the Anycast Station's primary inputs can be recorded to external hard disk drive. The Anycast Station allows synchronized recording of two primary input sources (per video interface board) to a third-party IEEE1394-interface-equipped hard disk drive connected to its rear panel. This means that with only two hard disk drives, 4 primary inputs can be recorded. After the event, connecting these hard disk drives to an IEEE1394-equipped compatible nonlinear editor allows editing to start very quickly, with the benefits of using hard drive storage to feed the source material. Streaming Encoder and Streaming Server The Anycast Station provides a built-in Streaming Encoder and a Streaming Server. The Streaming Encoder function allows the high-quality program output of the Anycast Station to be streamed in real-time - with minimum degradation and through very simple procedures - for distribution over the Internet, LANs, or private lines. When the number of clients is relatively small, the built-in Streaming Server function allows the streamed video to be distributed right from the Anycast Station without the need of an external streaming server connection.","","Rentals>Routers & Switchers>Production switchers","","","","","","""Sound Devices 442 4 Channel Audio Mixer","45","The Sound Devices 442 stereo field mixer encompasses the audio performance, feature set, and mechanical construction expected by those who rely on audio gear for their livelihood. <P>With its comprehensive inputs and extensive outputs, including direct outputs per channel, the 442 is at home in small run-and-gun applications as well as large, multiple-source productions.

When the control detects a subject, the green Sense LED glows and the calculated distance is shown on the LED display in either feet-inches or meters-centimeters. Adjustable brightness levels for the large red LED display offers comfortable viewing under different lighting conditions. The digital Sensitivity adjustment feature fine-tunes the system range, which is also helpful with different subject reflectivity. The Close Focus feature sets the minimum sense distance.

With its pan and tilt adjust/lock knobs, aiming the horns towards the subject is quick and straightforward. The SENSOR ASSEMBLY interfaces to the control via a short detachable Sensor Cable. A spring-loaded holder permits laser pens to be attached parallel to the sensors, providing a visual reference during calibration.","","2 categories:  1)  Rentals>Cameras>Accessories and 2) Rentals>Production Gear>Miscellaneous","","","","","","""Arri 24mm Macro Prime Lens","85","T2.1 with Minimum Focus at 6.5 inches","X","","Lenses","","","","","","""Arri 32mm Macro Prime Lens","85","T2.1 with Minimum Focus at 7.5 inches","X","","Lenses","","","","","","""Arri 60mm Macro Prime Lens","85","T3.0 with Minimum Focus at 11 inches","X","","Lenses","","","","","","""Bartech Analog Wireless Follow Focus System","125","The BFD exceeds the performance of the old standards (Seitz, WRC-4) at a fraction of the price.
